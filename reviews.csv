"✅ Trip Verified | We paid for the early bird service to get checked in as soon as possible so the 4 of us could sit together and we are clear back at the end of B. What a scam the early bird service is. We won't even be sitting together and when we called to talk to them, we were told that is very common even with the early bird service and that we should be happy it even checked us in. She said, ""it did what it was supposed to do."" Southwest could care less now that they have our extra $150. This is why we always fly Delta. Thought we would try southwest again, but got reminded why we never fly with Southwest."
"Not Verified | There were delays due to weather, of which I know the airline has no control over, on my trip from Tucson, AZ, with a stopover in Las Vegas, NV, then to my final destination of Ontario, California. On my returning trip, my flight to my stopover in Las Vegas was delayed due to the plane needing to be repaired, which we were told was in Phoenix, AZ. When I finally arrived in Las Vegas to catch my connecting flight back to Tucson, Az, I happened to be in the 2nd to the last row of the plane, having boarded with the C group. The last thing the flight attendant announced to the passengers was, “If you have a connecting flight, good luck!” Her tone was actually sarcastic in nature. She could have announced to all of the passengers to remain seated so those with connecting flights could deplane first. I had to run from gate A4 to gate B10 at the LV airport with only 20 minutes until my connecting flight was to depart. I am 70 years old, and pretty active, but I must have ran for more than a mile. No shuttles. No help. I heard my name spoken over the loud speaker at the airport to board the plane. I made it without a second to spare! The attendant told me he was just getting ready to delete my boarding pass. I will never fly Southwest again!"
"Not Verified | Open Seating is basically battle royal. What happened to Southwest? I’d go with Spirit or Ever After Airlines before Southwest. We took a wrong turn and ended up in Reno on a direct flight. Went from 2 hrs to 10. They asked us to pay for wifi when they didn’t have TVs but no USB, USB-C or 110v plugs. Had to land with a dead phone. On the way back, my family and I had to sit separate. A 9 and 11 yo in the back, my wife at the front of the plan in the middle. It was difficult to let this happen but when my kids said the Flight Attendant was rude when he asked for Apple Juice instead of Coffee I knew we made a mistake."
"✅ Trip Verified | Changed flights arriving from Puerto Rico, into Baltimore. Required wheelchair assist (due to an injury, wearing a knee high boot). I am 71 years old. My travel partner is 70. We both required wc assist. The wheelchairs were late, despite being requested at time flight was booked, and at each point of boarding, hence we were late boarding, and were at the back of the plane. Therefore, we were the last exiting. One of the pilots 'yelled hurry it up back there, we need to reload' as we were exiting one of the male staff said 'I thought they were having a BBQ back there'? The wwheelchairc left without us cause 'we took too long'"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I have now flown Southwest for four years. It has continued to go down with every aspect of Customer Service. I have accumulated up to $600 worth of vouchers because they continue to not deliver. I would not recommend this airline. Recently, as we were all boarded, then deplaned because a security check wasn’t completed. I couldn’t make my connection, had to wait two hours, when I arrived at my destination, my luggage wasn’t there. It was on the original flight and I had to wait another two hours. I had a 4 hour mountainous drive. I was supposed to arrive at 4 PM and arrived at 10 PM. This is only one of at least five terrible flights, as I mentioned, and the vouchers keep coming. On my return, they were late again as usual, we were waiting for another plane, which was smaller. An agent took the mic, and in a very militant voice said five of you are going to handover your carry-ons and we are going to put them in Luggage. She then proceeded to come up to me and said “you”! I had a rolling backpack with $10,000 worth of Camera gear. I said I’m sorry but I cannot put this in Luggage. She said “then you’re gonna have to take a later flight”! I thought, here we go again. I want to speak to a manager. Luckily within a few minutes, someone volunteered their piece of luggage. The plane barely had breathing room. You feel like you’re on a cattle call! Management, I have heard has changed and I was recommended by a few employees to write this review. They are charging for baggage, which I don’t mind paying but people don’t want to pay so they’ve loaded up on overhead space. Their business model seems to have changed. I don’t plan on using my $300 voucher. I have had nothing but disappointment,frustration, and major delays impacting my trip & health. Most of the time the employees are very nice, but this girl in Phoenix should be fired!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I was traveling alone with my toddler, who had his own seat. Toward the end of the flight, a flight attendant came to me with a trash bag, placed it in my lap, and told me, “I’m going to give this to you so you can get that up off the floor. Thank you,” in a condescending tone. I had already handed over our trash during the normal collection, but in this instance, I was singled out and spoken to in a way that felt disrespectful and dismissive. As a parent traveling alone, the flight was already stressful, and the interaction left me feeling judged and embarrassed. I understand that children make messes on planes and that crews have to clean between flights. My concern is not about cleaning, but about the way I was spoken to and treated. I hope the airline can address how attendants communicate with passengers—especially parents traveling alone—so that future passengers aren’t made to feel the way I did."
"Not Verified | As frequent Southwest customers who fly 10-12 times every year, we are beyond outraged and heartbroken over what happened to our family member at Chicago Midway Airport. The level of disrespect, neglect, and outright cruelty we witnessed from both Southwest Airlines staff and the Chicago Police Department is unacceptable. My 74-year-old mother, who requires wheelchair assistance, was denied proper help by Southwest staff. Not only did they fail to assist her, they refused to allow her to board the plane. Instead of showing basic human decency or making any effort to accommodate her, they escalated the situation unnecessarily. What's worse, the Chicago Police Department got involved--not to help, but to forcibly remove her from the terminal and throw her curbside without any assistance. For a senior citizen needing mobility support, this was not only humiliating--it was dangerous. Law enforcement should know better. They should have shown courtesy and common sense, not treated her like a problem to be thrown away. This kind of treatment is inhumane, especially toward someone elderly and vulnerable. We've been loyal customers of Southwest for years, but this was nothing short of brutality and neglect. There is absolutely no excuse."
"✅ Trip Verified |    Horrible customer service, rude, lack of knowledge and no customer focus. I understand delays, however when a delay occurs it’s Upto the airline to provide solutions. My flight was delayed for weather than maintenance, once the plane was at the gate and ready to board Southwest didn’t have a crew available."
"✅ Trip Verified | I’ve am a longstanding (frequent flier) SWA customer for many, many years, but I am reaching the end of that era. I sought assistance for early boarding at the red help desk on Sunday the 24th of August; only to have the employee roll her eyes with distain. No, I don’t want to use a wheelchair which is a resource I choose not to take advantage of… I am not obese or lazy, which is a lot of what you see anymore using the wheelchairs and taking up valuable staffing. I’ve had 4x back surgeries with implants. I carry my handicap place card, along with my speciality under side cushion. When I attempted to pull out my place card, she abruptly stated, “don’t pull that out, do I look like a car!” Beyond indignant, she then asks if I need a particular seat, I exclaim yes that I must have the aisle, so I can stand periodically to decompress my lumbar. She responds, everyone wants an aisle. This occurred at gate A14 SWA terminal at approximately 2:45pm, in case SWA cares to address one of their own. She could benefit with an etiquette course or better yet, relieve her of her duties. I am appalled, how dare she cast judgment when she knows nothing of my condition. I just need the extra time so I don’t hold anyone up during the boarding process nor can I be bumped. My surgeon says my back is glass, so I take every precaution available. This isn’t a strategy to gain better seating, because there’s no good seats on SWA anymore. They continue to cram us in like sardines. Honestly, I’m sure this isn’t an isolated occurrence because more often than none, the SWA flights aren’t full anymore. It’s like all  middle seating is available. Frankly, I would rather pay a little more going forward, then to be confronted with such unkindness by a person who is paid by my loyalty as a customer. Very disappointing and I hope she never finds herself in my condition because her karma would be ten-fold when it rears its ugly face. The final icing was that I was supposed to fly out on the 30th but had an emergency and needed to return a week earlier, and SWA made me pay nearly $200 more for said change. It is beyond ridiculous, but you have to pay because you’re a hostage and powerless when outside your home state. That flight from FL to MD round trip ended up being over $600 dollars. Thanks, but if I want to pay that sort of price point, I’ll stick with Delta and be appreciated for being a loyal customer without rolling eyes and demeaning responses when asked a simple question for early boarding."
"✅ Trip Verified |  SW used to be great now they want to charge $$ for everything even though you will probably get old planes, no phone charging, no internet, no entertainment. Pay for bags, seat selection, early boarding. You could get one way for 12000 points, now 30,000. I flew on 7/9/25 from San Diego to Nashville. I am disabled military and always preboard- I always offer to show them my military ID. Every time I ask if I need to get anything special ahead of time, they say no, just like flight to SD. Well this time, they would not let me on, made me go back up to desk in front of everyone. Were very rude, asks me three questions and tells me I have to answer them correctly. Then the guy comes up to desk, threatens to not let me on plane again if I cuss - I got my pass, told him I would be contacting corp. He said, that is fine, I will be warning them about you and putting a note on your account. He then proceeds to what I consider harassment and intimidation. He then comes down the ramp and hangs out until I get on. Then once on plane, he hangs out around me, puts his stomach right in my face, kind of adjusts the bags in overhead but only within 4 seats of me. It was so embarrassing, he made me feel like a criminal. I am 5'1"" 114 lbs. pretty small female in 50s."
"✅ Trip Verified |   The first time flying on SWA since their checked bag fees went into place. My bags were free because I purchased my ticket before the 5/28/25 switchover, but the bag drop line became so long and irritating (with a separate line for passengers with higher fare tickets). Flying back from Tampa I experienced a three hour delay due to mechanical issues. Got a $50 LUV voucher. After that less than stellar experience I think I will fly Delta and Breeze instead. At least they’re mostly on time, better organized and honest about their fee structure."
"✅ Trip Verified | Unbelievable Customer Service from Southwest Airlines! From flight delays to customer support, I truly had an unforgettable experience. My journey started with a delayed first flight, and stress quickly set in as I realized I might miss my connecting flight. But the amazing team on that first flight turned things around — they kept the mood light with humor and truly went above and beyond to ease the situation. To my surprise (and huge relief), my second flight was also delayed just enough… and the crew actually held the plane for a few minutes so I could make it! That moment alone was the cherry on top. Even better? My luggage made it too! I can’t express enough how grateful and impressed I am with the entire experience. Based on this trip, I’ll definitely be recommending Southwest to friends and family — and I’ll continue flying with you in the future. Thank you, Southwest!!"
✅ Trip Verified |   The airline had us wait on the plane for 4 hours in an un-aironditioned cabin. The pilot said the reason for delay in take off was that they had to check off a lot of things manuals since their electronic diagnostic instruments were malfunctioning. I wish we could have waited in the terminal rather than the cramped hot plane. After the 4 hour delay the weather turned bad and we never did take off and they had us wait in the terminal for another 4 hours. After the weather cleared they were unable to find pilots. The Airline cited bad weather as the only reason our flight was canceled and refused to compensate anyone or provide loggings for those stranded on connecting flights. And they lost our bags. Well they did reimburse the cost of the ticket from Baltimore to Portland they would not compensate those who were stranded via connecting flights and needed to book hotels. They provided no more than an automated apology message for having us wait 8 hours only to cancel. The worst part was defiantly the saying that weather was the only factor that lead to the cancel. It was manipulative and a clear attempt to alter facts so they were not legally required to provide refunds.
"Not Verified |  First time flying with Southwest and NEVER AGAIN. Terrible service, flight was packed, plane was late. Please save yourself a lot of money and headache and use a different carrier. Spirit was better because at least then I knew what I was paying for."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I made a mistake and booked my flight for the wrong morning. It was off by one day. Southwest cancelled my entire round trip per their policy. I called customer service and they rebooked me for the exact same return flight and the correct departure. Southwest refused to refund my return flight from the original booking that they cancelled “per policy”, even though I was actually on the flight.  If they ever cancel the whole trip because you happen to miss the first one, you will be out all of that money. If I would have booked two individual trips, they would not have cancelled the return. This is a terrible policy and just unfair. I have been a long time Southwest flyer, but now I will be seeking any other flights possible. Please be aware of this unfair policy!"
"Not Verified |  Went to the Front Desk and they obviously couldn't care less about your baggage and instead caring about joking around instead. That was the first issue, then as we're about to Board me and my passenger get pulled aside because we weren't gonna make the connecting flight. THEY SHOULD'VE TOLD US BEFORE WE GET BOARDED. In turn had to go the receptionist who slipped up and said that the people at the front are known to mess the process up via a company email. Now we have to wait even longer at the Airport due to the lack of communication on Southwest's part. I will not fly Southwest again especially at DCA , which is very disappointing because I flown with them for over a Decade."
"Not Verified |   Flight delayed for over three and a half hours, but once boarded, the airline still kept the plane load full of people waiting while they awaited the arrival of a Southwest employee who apparently needed to get to Boston for the next day. On arrival no gate was available so we were kept waiting again! Several hours wasted unnecessarily. Never flying this airline again."
✅ Trip Verified |   Chaos. The direct flight was canceled on July 10. They rebook me for the next day. The new flight is being delayed. No reasons given for cancelation or delays. Very frustrating and exhausting experience. Will stay away.
"✅ Trip Verified | Southwest Airlines has cancelled two of my last four flights with them. The first was a family trip in December 2023 and the most recent was today, July 9, 2025. Ironically, I used the flight credit from the December 2023 flight toward the purchase of today's flight. I was auto re-booked from flight 448 leaving PIT at 6:05 am to flight 568 leaving PIT at 5:50 pm, a 12-hour difference. The impact is more than the inconvenience of rescheduling parking, rental car, and hotel, as well as the cancellation of dinner reservations. The impact is what several business partners needed to hurdle to gather together around my trip, only to cause several rescheduled plans on their end - some involving their kids' activities. I have no confidence in Southwest Airlines."
"✅ Trip Verified |   The particular flight is not so important as the general experience with SWA of late. My recent flight was delayed which meant I'd miss the connection and I was charged several hundred dollars to board a new flight to get home. When I did speak to an agent about the exorbitant charge, she yelled at me! But usually one can't even reach customer service via phone (I was on hold >20 min today and finally had to hang up), flights have been delayed or cancelled more frequently, I can no long change one portion of my flight, of course the 2 bags for free policy went by the wayside, to change a flight requires an increase in price by hundreds of dollars when one use to be able to change for free or even get money back for a cheaper flight!. The wifi usually doesn't work even though it is offered for free to A List members, and I'm an ""A List Member"" which means zero. They simply don't care about the customer, whether A List or not. This new SWA is a train wreck and not sure if they have a new CEO or what? So remind me again why I spend every dollar on my Southwest Visa Card? I've no idea and plan to get a new Visa like cash back."
"✅ Trip Verified |   Proceed with caution with Southwest Airlines. MSY airport Flight #3678 On May 18th, 2025 approximately 10am, I was boarding Southwest Airlines to return home to Nashville from New Orleans. I was denied pre-boarding due to not meeting the 2 questionnaire qualifications. 1. Do you need assistance to board the aircraft? for example, wheelchair assistance, the use of a cane or other mobility device, etc. – the question was subjective. Could I use a wheelchair?  Yes, I could use a wheelchair. Could I use a cane? Yes, I could use a cane. I was clearly walking slowly with a limp and was experiencing a great deal of pain but I wanted to push through with whatever energy I had that day to return home. Matter of fact, my significant other was walking me to my seat to ensure I was safe. Does that not count as a ""cane"". Do you have a specific seating need in order to accommodate your disability?  I answered yes. Because I do not fly often, my family wanted to ensure I wasn't overworking myself trying to get home. I do not fly often and did not know that pre-boarding was an option for my condition. Quite frankly the whole ordeal was embarrassing, and I didn’t want to cause a scene, but my family insisted on getting an explanation and was concerned for my wellbeing. Upon asking for more clarification to explain to my family why I was denied pre-boarding, Southwest Airlines customer service (manager) rudely responded that what he answered was clear, when I was in fact did not understand and the manager made no attempt to deescalate the situation. The level of customer service presented that day was not because of my doing to deserve to be treated less than a human/person. Shame on you for subjecting someone to this level of embarrassment and falsifying the event that took place. I would also like to note that your staff allowed outside factors to determine my disability. When I reported the situation to through Southwest Airlines website, they provided a false narrative of the event. The negativity that they were receiving/experiencing was from the family. Not with me the handicap person.  I was experiencing a lot of pain standing and was on the verge of tears and had to end the conversation with no clarification for me to tell my family who were upset over the situation. It is now been 10 years since my horrific accident and I am now able to travel and this is the treatment that is given to people with disability? I have a total knee replacement, an ankle fusion, and both of my arms are also broken. Never in my life have I ever been asked these questions or was comfortable understanding to answer the questions with a room full of strangers. Since my disability I have made accommodation to ensure I would not get trampled by a group of people/strangers and I have made arrangements to arrive to the MSY Airport at a reasonable time for my condition. When I was at the BNA airport I was approved for pre-boarding. That day I was wearing shorts with scars up and down my left leg and was exhibiting limited mobility. When I was at the New Orleans airport I was wearing leggings that covered my scares and was exhibiting limited mobility. A Southwest Airline staff from the MSY Airport who scans boarding passes saw how much I was struggling and hand gestured me to come speak with her. She allowed me to the front of the line."
"Not Verified |    During check-in we had no issues, despite a major outage the day before. The 2 bags fly free policy, though now no longer in place, was really helpful for us at that time. The seat on the -800 had ample legroom, recline, a large pocket, and a usb/usbc outlet near the top of the seat, amenities that are not often seen on LCCs. During the flight, personal in-flight entertainment was available via the website, which featured a flight tracker, decent selection of movies, tv shows, and music, live tv, and free sms texting. In addition, a wide range of drinks was available for free, but a lack of food with only 2 snacks available for free and no paid options. Overall a pretty great LCC experience, with the only downside being the lack of food options onboard."
"✅ Trip Verified |   I used to fly Southwest over 100 flights a year over five years ago. I stopped because I saw the deterioration of the airline it’s employees and the way they treat people. I vowed never to go on Southwest again a beam that I traveled with them for 16 years. I gave them another try - this airline has now done nothing but try to make money by reducing the service for treatment and everything that set them apart. The little bags of peanuts have now become pretzels, smaller cups they used to be plastic have now become paper a lot smaller. The armrest on the seats have become thinner. The cushions have become thinner. The seats have become narrow. The gate service is almost nonexistent of how rude they become. They now charge for bags to name a few. One is better off flying to DFW and flying on one of the other airlines you get much better service much better snacks and if you’re gonna pay for luggage and everything else to Southwest is charging you you might as well do it with a much better airline. I will never fly them again."
"Not Verified |   Southwest is like any other airline. They're vague about what they say on their website and what they actually do; their employees are trained to repeat things over and over again without reaching a solution. They've abandoned all their competitive advantages. They've switched to assigned seats, baggage charges, and all the other additional fees."
"✅ Trip Verified | I wanted to do a special shout out to Marie at Houston Hobby. I had a lost phone on the plane and did not realize it until I had left the airport. When I returned to ask after my lost phone, I was met with helpful attitudes and smiles, which I really appreciated. Finally, I met Marie, who not only spent quite a bit of time trying to track my phone, but went the extra mile and walked all the way to the gate where she had learned a phone had been reported. So thank you so much, Marie at HOU! And thanks to all the Southwest crew and employees who are always so bright and helpful every time I fly with Southwest!"
Not Verified |  If you change any part or leg of your reservation you have to pay fees for all legs of the reservation. Apparently they changed their policy and made it retrospective even if you bought your ticket before the policy change (if you make any changes to any part of your reservation) You will be paying $35 for every bag. The customer service agent at MCO acted like he worked for TSA w wanna be a cop syndrome.. I'm Only flying DELTA from now on. Southwest officially sucks.
Not Verified |   First time flying Southwest. Problem. No seat assignments is a very major problem for families flying together. Airline micro snack is disgrace. It’s a laugh at the passengers. It’s like feeding snacks to your dog for doing good job. Not a single check in bags were free. Which I can understand everyone wants to make money. Overall poor service. Sorry Southwest air.
"✅ Trip Verified |   I booked my Southwest flight through Navan and tried to add EarlyBird Check-In afterward. Both the Southwest app and website showed that EarlyBird was successfully purchased and added to my reservation. Based on this information from Southwest's own systems, I assumed everything was in order and that I'd be automatically checked in early, as promised with EarlyBird. However, that never happened. At check-in, I discovered I had a terrible boarding position. When I called Southwest, I was placed on hold for 15 minutes while they ""investigated,"" only to be told that Navan never sent the payment. While that may be true, Southwest continued to display EarlyBird as active in their app and on their website the entire time — completely misleading and causing me to rely on incorrect information. Not only did no one take responsibility, but they also failed to explain why their system falsely showed the EarlyBird add-on as confirmed. If payment was never received, it should not have been shown as added. This misinformation directly led to me missing the opportunity to check in early manually. Southwest's response? ""There’s nothing we can do."" No apology. No compensation. Just blame-shifting and indifference. Very disappointed with how this was handled — both in terms of technology and customer service."
"Not Verified |  I had 4 flights for my family to get home extremely late. I saw that they had a different one that worked to get us home earlier so I changed to that one for $575. After getting to the airport, our new flight was delayed and now we will miss our connecting flight home. They now have us on the original flight home because it's the only one and they won't refund me my 575 dollars that I paid when I changed my flight. The lady at the kiosk was extremely rude. She had no empathy and refused to take care of me after I called her on her rudeness.  Delays happen, I get it but putting me back on my original flight home and keeping my 575 is a scam."
"✅ Trip Verified |   Both outbound/inbound legs were on B737-800 aircraft. On outbound leg, the flight attendant was very helpful with putting bags in the overhead bin. This is a rarity nowadays. Flight was delayed by 2h 16m due to weather. Pilot advised of ground stop after we pulled from the gate. On inbound leg, flight was delayed again to due to a mechanical issue. Southwest's ground crew worked with the flight crew to rebook those passengers who were going to miss their connecting flights in DAL. As always, the flight crews on both outbound/inbound legs were very friendly providing their usual no frills service. Restrooms were very clean and the onboard ICE was easy to connect to and fast."
"Not Verified |   Flew Southwest airlines from Las Vegas to Kansas City on Thursday March 20th, with about a 9:00am departure time, completely negating the fact that southwest is completely stripping their identity away this flight was easily the worst Southwest flight I had ever flown on. Ground staff at Harry Reid airport were nice enough but appeared stressed and overworked. The behavior of the cabin crew on this flight was atrocious, incredibly rude, and seemed to very begrudgingly be doing their job. Service was over and done with within the first thirty minutes of the flight and no further action from the cabin crew took place. Upon landing as I was disembarking, I gave my usual ""bye, thank you"" and was met with a scowl. I was formerly a big supporter of Southwest but now they have become a shell of what they once were."
"✅ Trip Verified |   On time departure and arrival for all 4 flights. Flights were relatively smooth. Aircraft clean with friendly flight crew providing the usual no frills service. IFE worked flawlessly with a good selection of movies. DAL-HOU, CUN-BNA and BNA-DAL were on B737-700 aircraft. This type of aircraft has no power ports to charge personal devices. Further there are no trays in the armrest in row 1. HOU-CUN was B737-MAX8. This is a gorgeous aircraft with large overhead bins and mood lighting."
"Not Verified |  The flight, plane, boarding was OK. The flight departed Denver at 5:45Pm. After we took off, the flight attendants came and handed out the usual crackers. I asked the attendant for water or drinks. She never came back, and I noticed NO drinks were handed out. This was a 2 hr 24 minute fight. To me, that was, a horrible, and preventable experience. Hydration is one of basic comfort and health. I felt unusually dry. I saw no reason for this. The flight wasn't full."
"Not Verified | I flew round-trip to visit family for Christmas week. On the outbound leg, all the flight attendants were decked out in their fanciest, tackiest holiday finery. We even had the Grinch try to run down the jetway at LaGuardia! Plentiful snacks, and the WiFi worked well enough for the in-flight entertainment (bring your own device for that). I was also able to use the WiFi to track my luggage through the Southwest website. The best part is, unlike other airlines, one can check up to two bags for free (very important when you're bringing NYC goodies to Brooklyn expats). Flights took off on time and arrived on time (the outbound to SMF arrived early, in fact, so early we had to wait for a gate). Ten out of ten, would recommend."
"Not Verified |  I get it. Weather is beyond technology control. However, SWA was just horrible today. Delay started before we even arrived at the airport. We sat at the gate through at least 4 delays. Not once did SWA made an announcement. Even when we finally started boarding there was no advance notice. When I inquired at the counter the staff said they don’t know and staff at the gate would make an announcement. Gotta love how they deflect and play the “not me” card. Poor communications and poor customer service. SWA, you can do better."
"✅ Trip Verified |   Never Again. It's ""open seating"" you can squeeze in somewhere in the middle if you have kids 10 and under. Never heard of this. Far less amenities than any other flight (American, Alaska, United, etc.) No chargers, no food, and the ""open seating concept"" when families are involved is insane to me. I will never again fly Southwest. I've been hearing their end is near and I can see why."
"✅ Trip Verified | They separate you from your companion and also from your luggage, even though customer service indicates that they are supposed to seat you together. Boarding seems like a ranch where the cattle have been released. Also, cabin toilet was very dirty. Do not engage. You will be sorry."
"Not Verified | I have a Southwest Rapid Rewards credit card. We also have vouchers because of canceled flights during which they provided no hotels for my stranded wife. Regardless, as I wish to upgrade my seating Southwest refuses to take their own points, can't confirm existence of vouchers, and won't apply vouchers to flight upgrades anyway. I quit using my Southwest card 18 months ago because of how unaccommodating Southwest is. But I have all these remaining points, and I can't give them away. Southwest runs a good flight, but their customer service outside of their flights is not good."
"✅ Trip Verified |   Uneventful flight with on time departure and arrival. Usual Southwest no-frill service. Clean aircraft and friendly flight crew. In Flight Entertainment was easy to log on and watch live TV (NFL football). Unusual for this particular aircraft, the overhead cabins were not as large as other 737-800 aircraft,"
"✅ Trip Verified |   Same plane on both DAL-DCA and DCA-PVD. Aircraft was very clean with the pleasant flight crew providing the usual no frills service. IFE worked flawlessly. There was a good selection of movies and live TV; however, there are no power ports to charge personal devices at the seats (iPhones or iPads). An added bonus on the connecting flight to PVD - I got a whole row to myself which is a rarity nowadays."
✅ Trip Verified |   Great airline! Very friendly staff. Flown with this airline around 28 times and never had a bad experience only 5 of my flights have Been delayed and none cancelled.
"Not Verified |  On 9/30/24 I was buying a ticket for my mom to come with me on a trip. After I purchased the ticket, I realized I had inadvertently gotten a duplicate ticket for myself. My mistake, I really don't know how I missed putting in her details. I cancelled that ticket and was immediately going to buy her ticket, so I just did a flight credit. I put in her information and everything was going well until I tried to pay. I could not use the flight credit to pay for her ticket because the flight credit was in my name! I saw that the credit was transferable, so we made her an account, transferred the credit and bought her ticket. On Oct 2nd we cancelled the ticket. As it was past the 24 hours for free cancelation and a refund she got a flight credit to transfer back to me since I paid for the ticket. She was unable to do this because you can only transfer one time. As a new user with Southwest I was unaware that when you get a flight credit you can only use it for a flight in your name. I thought that I would have a credit to use however I needed as it is my money. Then when we cancelled the flight and she was issued a credit I fully expected that I could have it transferred back to me. I'm sure that there are others who hadn't read the one time rule either. So, I find that Southwest doesn't care if they cheat you out of your own money! First by issuing you flight credit that you can't use as you wish. It's my money, I should be able to purchase a ticket for anyone I want. Second by only allowing a one time credit transfer. I realize that it was my mistake in the first place not putting the ticket in her name, but it was a mistake. Southwest had the opportunity to rectify this when I called and when I filed a complaint. I didn't ask for a refund, I simply wanted the flight credit back in my name. So for an honest mistake, I have lost over $711. Had I purchased the first ticket in her name, when she cancelled and got a flight credit, she would've been able to transfer it to me no issues, as that would've been the one and only transfer. For those who would say have my mom give me $711 and she has a flight credit to use. She cannot afford that, which is why I was buying her ticket in the first place. It would hurt Southwest in no way, shape or form to simply return the flight credit back to me. They still get the $711 revenue. The paper trail is there. They can clearly see the mistake of the duplicate ticket and they obviously know how their 'rules' twist this mistake all around to cheat me out of $711. I will never fly Southwest again. Buyer beware!"
"✅ Trip Verified |   This airline made it impossible to sit with your spouse. Sharing the food we brought was also not possible. Bad open seating policy. When you board the plane, you get whatever seat is left over."
"✅ Trip Verified | I fly several times a year. When we got on this plane, there were things wrong with it like the pic I posted. The flight crew was absolutely horrible. However this plane took off late. We had a 45 min layover in Baltimore to get to Dallas. The crew were absolutely no help. We had to get through two other terminals and when we landed our plane should've been taking off. Of course people all get up and we can't get out of our seats to get off of the plane. Finally one of the crew said we have passengers that need to get out first because their plane is leaving. But nothing was done and people proceeded to get their HUGE bags from the cargo bins. When we finally got off, we ran through two terminals and our plane was loading. Luckily they were late too but I asked the girl at the entry gate if she could notify the plane in the other terminal and she didnt even respond. I will never fly this airline again."
"Not Verified | My flight number was #4609. The crew was absolutely wonderful, there was also a pilot on board flying home for time off. They could not have more accommodating. Southwest Airlines seems to hire the best of the best."
"Not Verified | My parents were flying home and my father called Southwest to check in. He was told that they were going to be bumped from the flight and could either fly on another day without paying or they could “upgrade” their fare for over $400 to remain on the flight, causing them to have to put out money they don’t necessarily have. They are retired and on a fixed income and they had to get home due to pet sitting obligations. When I talked to the Southwest representative, the only thing they would do for my parents is upgrade their boarding numbers. Once they got to the airport this “overbooked” flight was allowing standby passengers on the plane and there were several open seats. Not sure if this has ever happened to anyone else with Southwest but it sounds strange to me."
Not Verified | I noticed that Southwest Airlines does not honor Military Disabled Veterans. I requested if I can board with Pre-Boarding so I can sit at least in the forward seats. One of my disability is sitting in the back. I was denied.
"Not Verified | Upon receiving notice that our home in Florida is without power, water and sewage we had to delay our departure by one week. When I called I was told it would be an additional charge of $266.00. I could understand the charge if I were merely changing the reservation for convenience. But these are conditions are beyond my control. I don’t imagine we are the only customers suffering. We usually only fly Southwest to Florida and back to Cleveland in the spring."
"✅ Trip Verified |   Southwest had to delay by over an hour because they didn’t assign a pilot to these constant delays. Didn’t use to be a thing but in recent days they are so incompetent they can’t even properly assign pilots to flights they have planned months in advance. Incompetent people are plaguing Southwest now, customer service is absolutely rancid, they. And even get planes out on time anymore. I have a very important business trip to be on time for and I’m losing sleep over this. Ticket price is the most expensive it’s ever been and service is lower than ever. The airplanes are aging, the service sucks, constant delays. Just atrocious"
"Not Verified | We left our house at 6 am, boarded the first flight at 9. Our second flight was cancelled ""due to weather "" which was a lie. The canceled flight had us wait about 4 hours for the next one. We were supposed to arrive at 7, we arrived at 10. Baggage took about another 20 minutes. Flying used to be fun and exciting, now you feel like everyone is annoyed at you and all agents and gate attendants are mad. No one cares that your plans got screwed up or if your inconveniencing people when your new pick up time is hours after you initially told them. Big airline companies are just booking too many people, to many flights and then lying when they mess up. It's really disappointing. Don't even get me started on what a terrible traffic managing system they have for picking up people at the Boston Airport. An old drill sergeant screaming at the top of his lungs, getting mad at everyone. Just sad. Do better southwest, do better Boston Airport"
Not Verified | The flight attendant on flight 3641 was amazing. Especially the one manning the back of the cabin. She assisted a young mother with three children the mother seemed overwhelmed and this flight attendant was able calm down the mother and settle the children in and create a pleasant flight bravo.
"✅ Trip Verified |   Delayed flight for no reason, no explanation, ac extremely cold, 2 babies crying non stop for 2 hours. Because of the delay I couldn’t get my car rental, traveling with my 4 kids , stranded at the airport until 7 am when they open again. Last time I do Southwest, never again."
"✅ Trip Verified |   Southwest Airlines are awful and I never want to book with them again. I booked tickets 3 months ago, missed my flight and they cancelled my flight back with no refund. My flight hasn't even happened yet. I told them I want to book the flight out again and they want me to pay for my flight I've already bought and then maybe I could get a refund. They said no promises. The flight hasn't even happened yet."
"Not Verified | I lately tried to contact Southwest Airlines using their customer support variety however encountered lengthy wait instances that proved quite irritating. After numerous attempts with out a resolution, I decided to reach out to a different Southwest Airlines contact range at 1-855-550-0687. To my remedy, I became linked immediately to a customer support representative with none wait time. This enjoy highlighted a tremendous inconsistency in their customer service accessibility. While I appreciate Southwest Airlines for his or her finances-pleasant alternatives, the long wait instances on their number one customer support line may be a main inconvenience for passengers seeking help. I inspire Southwest Airlines to streamline their customer service methods to make sure that every one clients acquire well timed and powerful help. Overall, my enjoy was improved by way of the spark off help from the change contact, and I hope destiny interactions are further green."
"Not Verified | I bought half a year ago a flight for $500 to Chicago, MDW. That is a 45 min. flight without any issues. However, the day of checking in they cancel my flight and put me on another one that I can't possible rearrange due to my work commitments within hours. Southwest are worse than any profession I have seen. They sell you a product and in fact they try to upsell you with this an that, more legroom, more luggage allowance, and if you then still can afford the extra premium to make your flight insured and exchangeable, you can actually act on your rebooking and do something about it. That was not the case because $500 was not enough to give me the rights to complain or ask for reimbursement or ask for a free rebooking. So, I am stuck with a business day that is completely ruined from one minute to the other, well planned by Southwest and delivered to me at the last minute on check-in day. Honestly, that was my one attempt to give them a chance to become my Airline after the pandemic, but after this disappointing encounter with Southwest Airlines, I don't think so. I'll pass on them gladly in the future."
"Not Verified |  MDW-DEN. A really uneventful flight which is just the way to go. Easy check-in with pleasant ground staff. On time departure, smooth flight with typical Southwest snack and beverage service. Flight staff pleasant. Entertainment/Wifi worked perfectly so watched a movie to pass the time. On time arrival in Denver which gave us plenty of time to relax and grab a bite to eat before our connecting flight. Nothing to fault on this trip."
"✅ Trip Verified |   Second time flying Southwest this year and a pleasure like last time. Checked in through the app 24 hours before also had the option to catch an earlier flight for free but opted out of that. Dropping my bag off at midway was easy and I was helped by an agent. The flight was delayed 30 mins but we still landed on time at LGA. The crew on this flight was wonderful and offered me a free margarita due to the delay. I do have to say some passengers decided they wanted to use the restroom after doors closed and we were about to taxi in which the crew nicely asked them to wait until after takeoff and two Dominicans started making an fuss and lying saying they were targeted just cause they weren’t white when I confronted them telling them it’s because the plane needed to taxi they hushed. Free soda and pretzels were offered, I had a sandwich I bought at the airport and the best part was I had the whole row to myself. There’s a huge selection of movies through their inflight entertainment and free text messaging. Ten out of ten on this short hop back to the East Coast."
"Not Verified |  Reno to Chicago. Convenient route that Southwest operates in the summer. We showed up less than 30 minutes before departure and were still able to check in and run to the gate and make the plane. It was a full flight and we were the last two on so our seats were not the best, but that was our fault. On time departure. Typical snack and beverage service. Ground staff and flight crew were all pleasant. Almost 4 hour flight was smooth. Wifi was a bit sketchy so I just listened to music. All was good and we made it to Chicago on time. And our luggage made it. We were so late checking in that we were given notice that our bags may not make it to the plane in time, but they did."
"Not Verified |  Incompetence across the board as always. Having to switch up their seat policy which is the only difference between them and other airlines is enough proof. Yet somehow they seem to mess up every single. time. They have no communication between airports, lose your luggage, non stop delays, cant even follow their own boarding arrangement, and the most incompetent flight attendants out of all the domestic airlines. If you've never flown them and you’re thinking about it, don't, save yourself the headache."
"Not Verified | My dad and I traveled together for the first time in about 18 years due to a significant injury that left him in a wheelchair, paralyzed from the neck down. Given the level of support needed a fear surrounded travel for him. I've begged him for years to get out of the house and explore, some things may be limited for him, but travel did not have to be one of those things. And he finally listened! We took off on a direct flight from Buffalo, NY to Las Vegas to catch a show at the amazing Sphere. We were so wonderfully taken care of thanks to Southwest Airlines, they were beyond accommodating. They provided a great staff to support with transitions to and from his chair into the airplane seat, they were understanding, personable, and kind. They used great communications from one airport to the next so once we arrived in Vegas the other attendants and staff knew the level of support in which was needed. I am pleased with their service and because of the smoothness of the experience, I think it has opened the doors up for future travel for my dad. Thank you, Southwest!"
Not Verified | My daughter and I had the pleasure to fly on flight number 2622 to California. I required a wheelchair and it was there everytime I needed it. The crew were extremely nice and got me on and off safely. The best part was that this flight was on time to the minute. The turbulence was tolerable..cudos to the pilot. In the future I will fly again with southwest airlines.
"Not Verified |   Have flown Southwest many times, and this recent flight was quite enjoyable. Departures were delayed slightly to pick up standby passengers stranded due to the IT outage however the airline kept passengers informed. Seat was comfortable for the hour and a half flights and staff were pleasant. Overall easy, straightforward and fairly affordable."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Since when did Southwest Airlines at BNA airport in Nashville start a new policy that charges you to checkin your already paid for luggage at curbside, or you have to go inside to boarding passes and checkin your already paid for luggage for “free”? I have flown on all the major airline carriers throughout my entire 40 something year life, and have never been forced to pay to check in my already paid for luggage at curbside? This sounds like fraudulent business practices by employees at this location."
"Not Verified |   KOA-OAK-RNO. Kona to Oakland had on time departure. Easy check in. All staff were pleasant on ground and in the air. Had several drink rounds and typical Southwest snacks. Entertainment system worked just fine on our own devices with decent selection of movies, TV, games, etc. Only negative is that this plane had no charging ports for personal devices. I was OK as I was fully charged up before flight. Smooth flight to Oakland. Our two hour layover in Oakland started to increase by half hour increments shortly after arrival. But we were kept informed. In the end our two hour layover turned into a five hour layover. Mechanical issue with the plane we were waiting for lead to a change of equipment causing the delay. Things happen. We were told we could apply for compensation after we got home since we were delayed for 3 hours. Finally got on our flight back to Reno and got in three hours later than expected. All our luggage arrived safe and sound. The next day we submitted our compensation request and 3 days later we were approved and received the compensation. Southwest did us right."
Not Verified |   OGG-HNL. Easy check-in. Plane was an hour behind schedule but was informed earlier in the day so not a problem. Pleasant staff and ground crew. Flight is only 25 minutes so no beverage or snack service if I remember right. Didn't have time to check out the entertainment system. Luggage arrived safe and sound. Enjoyable flight for a quick island hop.
"✅ Trip Verified | I was originally booked a round trip flight with Southwest traveling from Austin to San Diego. This was the first time flying with Southwest and I'm traveling for business. I thought I'd give Southwest a chance this time instead of flying with United or American. Flight from Austin to San Diego was fine. On my trip back to Austin, I had checked in 24 hours before my flight and had a boarding pass. I then proceeded to call Southwest customer service to inquire about the cost of changing to a flight later on Friday evening instead of flying out Saturday afternoon. I decided against changing my flight due to the fare difference, I told the service agent that I will keep my original flight. Everything was going fine on the day of my flight until I was trying to board. The boarding pass on my phone apparently wasn't valid even though I had used it to get through TSA security and it worked there. I was then told that I don't have a ticket booked back to Austin. I was in shock and confused as to what was happening because I checked in fine, got through security fine and was ready to board. The first desk agent at the gate was of no help just saying there's nothing they can do, completely useless. Another 3 people came after and made some calls and tried to figure it out. They finally got it figured out that there was an issue on Southwest's end and the funds were there for my flight but for some reason my original ticket back to Austin was canceled. By that time the gate door had closed and the only flight was 6 hours later! I'm left here at the airport for 6 hours longer than I ever want to be with this issue that I didn't know could even happen when I was at the airport by the gate 90 minutes before departure. Ridiculous that this issue can even come up for what Southwest claims to be a major airline with agents giving up and not helping at first. How is it possible to accidently cancel someone's flight from a normal inquiry about flight changes? That's a standard request. Terrible first experience with Southwest, I do not plan to fly with Southwest again."
Not Verified |   Our 6:10 am departure time on our flight from Albany to Chicago Midway was delayed. They delayed the flight a 1/2 hour because there was a large number of people that were late for the flight. They said TSA was backed up. I have a real issue with my husband & I being the scape goat for others tardiness! If those that were late had gotten to the airport 2 hours prior to their departure they would have been on time. Because of their tardiness - my husband & I were the ones that suffered. We missed our connecting flight in Chicago & now have a 5 1/2 hour layover til the next flight. We had A Boarding on our early connecting flight and now have the last C Boarding numbers. When we talked several agents requesting our original boarding status back and were told “that’s not going to happen.” Further stated that’s not how we do it! Not a good experience with Southwest! Their decision to hold the plane in Albany was beneficial to late passengers but really inconvient for us who got to the airport 2 hours prior to departure!
"✅ Trip Verified |  Southwest used to be good but I travelled yesterday jun 26, 2024 after many years and it was a lousy experience. The flight times are 6pm leave SJC and arrive 1130pm dallas love field. There was some problem with the plane and they kept shift departure time until the announced after 3 hr delay that they have a new plane. We landed at DAL around 3am, and the car rental had closed by then at the airport. Any airline where delay is > 2hrs especially with arrival after midnight must refund 50% of the ticket. The staff at san jose said it is out of control."
"✅ Trip Verified |  If you fly business never fly Southwest Airlines. They have the most stupid system of boarding without preassigned seats, and you have to stand in line otherwise you might lose your space for hand luggage. Also there is no business class, you just get to board at the beginning after a good amount of standing waiting. Very bad."
Not Verified |   Reno-Oakland-Kahului. Easy check in at Reno. On time departure. Beverage and snack served on 28-minute flight to Oakland. Easy transfer in Oakland onward to Hawaii. On time departure. Arrived early and all luggage showed up. Really good attitudes from ground staff and flight staff. All seats had their own power plug that worked. On flight entertainment worked fine with good selection of shows/music/movies. No complaints on either flight.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Outbound leg on B737-MAX 8 and inbound on B737-800. Outbound flight was delayed by 40 minutes due to severe weather in the area. Once airborne, the flight encountered some turbulence until it cleared the weather system affecting Dallas. Inbound flight departed on time. ICE worked flawlessly on the outbound flight; however, the inbound flight was beset with buffering and/or no connection at all. On both flights, flight crew were courteous and provided the usual Southwest friendly no-frills service."
"Not Verified | My son and I were flying to Massachusetts for a nice vacation. Well Southwest Airlines had a different plan. They decided to turn it into a 3 ring circus. They changed our flights both departing and returning. We get to the airport only to find out we have a 5hr delay this was while we were at the airport. Then a gate change followed by a constant flight time change. We go through Chicago and finally get to Manchester, NH. Wait for it the trip back was even more fun. Flight was changed to earlier time, gate change and two stop to get back to Tennessee. Needless to say they just fly by the seat of their pants literally."
"Not Verified |   The worst airline I have ever flown. Delays, cancellations but the biggest problem is luggage. They just cannot get checked luggage moved to onward flights. This is the third time they have lost my luggage. Now I am in Guadalajara Mexico with no luggage. When I checked my luggage, and again in Denver when I arrived that I explained I had a checked medical device I needed at my destination. How important it was to move my luggage to my onward flights. This is the third time they have failed to send my luggage over to United Airlines in Denver. The layover was 3 hours. They had plenty of time to transfer my luggage. Just did not do it. Again!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I showing up to the airport to find your flight is delayed. Can be frustrating but thanks to the amazing customer service I received from Silvava and Ashley, I was still smiling even after three delays and one cancellation. I just wanted to say thanks to these Amazing reps. Please keep showing up and give your best."
"Not Verified |   Not able to walk distances, had to use transport chair around airports, to and from planes. Had a lot of assistance by Southwest Crews. They made the chair fun, enjoyed the assistance. Landed in Denver, again the assistant was joyful, we had fun playing around. Didn't know until terminal my family asked why I was special. Turned in time to notice the assistant was one of the pilots. Was a joyful trip with friendly, fun, special and professional Southwest Employees."
"✅ Trip Verified | Southwest has either delayed or cancelled flights on the last FIVE trips I’ve taken. These changes have caused significant expenses due to prepaid lodging and rental cars. I understand that things happen, but with Southwest Airlines, it’s EVERY SINGLE TRIP."
✅ Trip Verified |  I used to prefer Southwest over any other airline but recently after experiencing some harassment regarding HIPAA violations and asking for medical preboarding at the San Antonio Airport I am considering never flying Southwest again. I typically get medical priority boarding due to multiple disabilities and anxiety issues while flying and when I asked about it I was told because I'm not physically disabled they wouldn't give it to me. Then proceeded to ask why I needed it until I listed my disabilities. At this they finally provided me with it. Well even after scanning my ticket and letting me walk down the tunnel to begin getting on the plane they stopped me and made me come back up telling me I had to gate check either my rolling carry on or my backpack. When I tried to explain that I keep my medical supplies in both bags they told me to either move my supplies to one or find a different flight. By now I was already dealing with a low blood sugar and was on the verge of passing out as a result and so I elected to just move everything over but it was embarrassing and delayed me being able to care for myself and my health properly.
"Not Verified |   Las Vegas-Reno via San Diego. Easy check-in and early morning departure all on time. Quick flight to San Diego with a short change of planes onward to Reno. San Diego is a horrible airport. Small, cramped, limited seating, crowded, etc. Had to exit airport, go through baggage, go through TSA again just to change gates. Why there is no connecting walkway is beyond me. It is such a short distance. This is not a negative to Southwest but rather to the airport. On time departure from San Diego to Reno. Standard snack and beverage on both flights. All crew pleasant and friendly. Another good experience with SW."
"Not Verified |   Reno-Las Vegas. Reno airport is one of the easiest airports to use. From parking to check-in to TSA to the gate is 15 minutes. The flight was running about 15 minutes late. Boarding was easy. Staff and crew were friendly. Standard beverage and snack offered on short 1 hour flight. Smooth ride to Vegas. Once landed we parked quickly at the gate. Luggage arrived quickly and was basically waiting for us when we got to the carousel. All in all, it was a really good flight."
"Not Verified |   Absolutely terrible. People pre boarding who are clearly not pre board eligible. Wi-Fi never worked. Terrible, will never fly them again. No customer care."
✅ Trip Verified |  Six delay updates and still sitting at Phoenix airport. Weather out west is nice so that excuses won't work for me. Please use American air if you want dependable service. I now know why SW has been rated worst in the industry.
✅ Trip Verified |  I’ve been waiting for 4 hours and they wouldn’t let me on my flight. Now I have to wait and be rerouted. Adding 5 hours to my time. Choose someone else.
"✅ Trip Verified |  My father and I were scheduled for a flight out of Indianapolis to Atlanta, April 18, 2024, boarding 12:25pm B20, and sat for 2 hours waiting to hear our flight over the intercom but the flight was never announced to have changed to B21. We didn’t hear our names being called until 1:15pm but never heard that our flight had been changed to B21. We quickly got up out of our seats that were facing B20 and went up to the women at the counter and asked why our names were being called and they said we were too late just seconds after they had just called our names. Now I know they were being less than honest because the young lady hearing us out was also confused as to why our tickets read B20 when in fact it was B21. I never heard them make any changes to our flight, the flight was still there, and they had just called our names. I remember hearing countless updates for Tampa and Fort Meyers but never once did I hear Atlanta was being changed to B21. Subsequently missing our flight and losing out on an important trip to Atlanta. They changed our flight to later time but this doesn’t fix their mistake that will cost me time and money."
"Not Verified |   Our flight attendants name was Sarah she was good, but the other woman was not Miss congeniality. She was rude and short with the people not in her area. I’m sorry but there is a better way to convey your words. She told a woman who was having a problem walking to the bathroom from the first seat and wanted her hand that she wasn’t allowed to get up. You could tell that when people asked for something and they were not in her section she got perturbed."
"Not Verified |   Southwest needs to rewrite their seating policy, unbelievable to pay $250 one way and be stuck on opposite sides of the aircraft from your wife on her first flight ever. Never again Southwest!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I don’t travel very much, but when I do I expect to have good customer service. The staff is the very worst, I am very dissatisfied and disappointed. The front desk staff are not friendly at all. They act like they are being inconvenienced and rude as hell. They don’t smile and have an attitude when I ask for help. I was very surprised how terrible the service is. I expected better from Southwest Airlines. Why are people so angry?"
"Not Verified |   On 3/19/2024, I encountered an unexpected issue while attempting to check in for a Southwest flight at the airport. Despite having booked my flight a month in advance on 02/12/2024 for a family funeral trip scheduled from 03/19 to 3/25, I was informed by a Southwest agent that I needed a consent form from my sisters to travel with my minor niece and nephew. This requirement was unfamiliar to me, as I had previously traveled with the minors on Southwest Airlines without encountering this request. The interaction with the agent and their supervisor was disheartening, as they exhibited rudeness and disrespect towards me. Despite my explanations and requests, they did not show a willingness to review my travel history with the minors or consider the circumstances of my family's bereavement. Additionally, I was given conflicting information about the acceptance of a notarized letter from the minors' guardian, causing further confusion and inconvenience. I respectfully request a review of this incident, as it has caused distress during an already challenging time. I hope that this feedback can contribute to improvements in customer service and clarity of travel requirements for passengers, particularly in sensitive situations such as family emergencies. I had a difficult experience with Southwest Airlines, as I was unable to board the flight and encountered unhelpful customer service. Despite this, I received a refund. I then booked with American Airlines and had a positive experience. I will be choosing American Airlines for future travel."
"Not Verified |  We had to rebook flights the day before flying due to a massive snowstorm. Our direct flight was changed to a connecting flight, but the connecting city was closer to our point of origin, so we just hopped in the rental car and drove. Little did we know that hidden in the fine print is a ""no show"" policy. If you don't cancel your flight and just don't show up, they cancel all flights on your itinerary, including your return flight. It doesn't matter that you already purchased your seats. They will take your money or points and leave you without a flight. What's more, if you purchase the highest price points tickets, they will refund your points, but if you purchase cheaper seats, they take your points. This feels like a poor penalty to me. We have been loyal Southwest customers for 20 years, including the credit card. No more. We are taking our business elsewhere. Our 20 years of loyalty apparently means nothing to this heinous company."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I’ve flown bi-weekly for a year for work. I came back from a work conference this week with a bag one pound over the limit. I was told to pay $100 or to get a trash bag to check my items as a “separate package”. When I asked for a supervisor to clarify (since southwest allows for 2 free checked bags), the supervisor tried to guilt me by saying “you need to think of our staff who is on their hands and knees loading these bags. They don’t need to be moving overweight bags. Wouldn’t you agree? It’s unfair for a passenger to ask that of them?” Ma’am- it was one pound and I know your policy allows for heavier bags for your elite members. Do you pay the employee the $100 you asked me to pay if they have to “get on their hands and knees” to lift a bag one pound over? I’ve seen how these bags are handled. Southwest broke a family heirloom on my last flight with them because of how rough they are. Don’t try to make me feel bad because I was told to put my items in a trash bag and hope they arrived. I’ll never fly southwest again. I appreciate the supervisor’s ability to argue- but don’t act like it’s because the airline cares about their staff. It’s a way to make money. Google how much the airline industry makes in overweight bag fees, then tell me they do it to protect their staff."
"Not Verified |   Worst airline in the USA. Long time since I flew Southwest and last in a very every long time to come. Flights delays and cancellations are common bread now a days. Consumer satisfaction and priority no longer exists. This airline has stopped being an on time airline. Last time flew Southwest was 2021. Next time be sure it will be at least 2031 if ever. Southwest you lost a customer, will make sure none of my family or friends fly Southwest"
"Not Verified |   Horrible experience. Our original flight time was 11:30am. They delayed it to 2:00pm. We were fine until we arrived at the airport. They delayed our flight to 7:28pm! That's about 8 hours after we were supposed to leave. The weather wasn't even bad. It was beautiful outside and there was no storms at all. The delay was due to ""Air traffic control"" even though no other airline such as Delta or United had delayed or canceled flights. After waiting an hour at the airport, they cancelled our flight and would not give us a refund at first. We had a week long trip ahead of us that we couldn't go on because of Southwest. We also saw families of 8 going to Disney World Orlando and you can't get a refund from that either. Now we are trying to cancel everything we had planned for the trip. We lost a lot of money on this. I wish I could give 0 stars."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I fly Southwest a lot and normally I am happy with the flight and the people so it saddens me to have to write this. I'm disabled and going to DCA I had to walk through the airport because the people pushing the wheelchairs were rude. Then to make it worse, I make it to the gate and the Southwest employee says ""you can't walk down this shoe way to the plane"" after I advise that I need a wheelchair. I was so embarrassed that I just sat and cried and when it was time to board I asked a passenger who was also disabled and received rude service if she wanted to walk together and help each other. Then to make matters worse when I was due to return the flight got delayed but nobody said anything. They just walking past us looking as if it was necessary for us to know what was going on. We waited almost 45 min to an hour before we could board. Just terrible customer service all around the board."
"✅ Trip Verified | Worst business practice I’ve seen. They canceled my flight and did not notify me. The only explanation they gave was, it was a glitch in their system. Found out I had no flight when I tried to check in. When I eventually got ahold of someone the only choice they gave me was to rebook my flight at a much higher price."
"✅ Trip Verified |  This review is for the Southwest hotel concierge. I usually book hotels through Southwest for the rewards points. On the last booking of 12/23, I was charged an additional $900+ the day after checking out. I made two inquiries to Southwest as to why and the first response was a link to understanding hotel charges. The second expressed concern, asked for proof, which I sent a copy of my credit card statement, and was told to expect a reply answer in 3 to 5 business days which never came. I replied to this email 3 weeks later asking for an update and then 2 weeks after since I did not get a reply, nothing yet. All I asked was for a reason as why the double charge. I'm a person of habit and been flying only Southwest for at least 20 years. I will probably continue using the airline for flights, but not their extended services."
"Not Verified |   We had the worst flight attendant on flight 1735, we were told that if we paid extra to board early we can save seats for our family members. The flight attendant was so rude and said that the person at the ticket counter wasn’t a flight attendant. She then signaled people to sit on the seats we were saving for 2 family members, one of us is disabled and the other one is partial medical injured. She was so condescending and rude, even made a comment that “if I can stop being Interrupted, I can get back to my introduction” - not the attitude of a flight attendant. I’m beginning to think that these flight attendant’s instigate negative energy in order to create a hostile atmosphere so that they can kick you off the plane if you say something. This one needs to go home or at least some rest. Not an enjoyable flight on our way to a family funeral."
"Not Verified |  I was very disappointed with the flight attendants. They were complaining about their lack of pay and that they didn’t get paid equally to the pilots. They were also complaining about the fact that they didn’t get paid until the passengers were all seats and the door was closed. I don’t think they should have been complaining about the airline not taking care of them. Let alone in front of customers. This went on for almost the entire 3 hours of the flight. It must be a big problem as the connecting flight was also a discussion the same topic.  I really didn’t want to hear about their problems of work. I did contact customer service to find out that they were not willing to listen and referring me to the airline website. So I did, only to receive an automated email back. Stating they were sorry for any inconvenience. Needless to say I am not going to make the return trip with this airline. It may cost more but I guess you do get what you pay for. I just wanted to give a little feedback to the airline. They are just like a lot of other companies “ it’s all about the dollar, not the customer experience."
"Not Verified |  Look elsewhere. I have flown with Southwest almost exclusively for the last 20 years, Can't do it anymore. They will Cancel your Flight for any reason. Presently sitting in Oakland for 5 extra hours. Thats if they dont cancel that flight. I have been stranded by them more then I can Count. SWA is now the worst airline."
"Not Verified | SW is a total joke, our connecting flight from Sac. to Portland was cancelled due to bad weather in LV. I understand that can happen, but SW did little to nothing to get us to Portland the following day. SW's great idea was Sac to Ontario to Denver to Portland. 10 hours to get from Sac. to Portland, I could have rented a car and beat SW back to my hometown. Clowns!!"
"Not Verified |  We booked a flight from Milwaukee to Cancun with one layover in Kansas city, upon arriving at the airport we were told of change of flight 40 minutes earlier! Problem to Baltimore! This is completely out of the way. We were to arrive in Cancun at 1:15 but with this new flight now 4:15. Today is our anniversary and we have to put up with this because they can't run a company! I'm hoping this will be the last time having to deal with them."
Not Verified | A great flight at a reasonable price! The 2 free checked baggage is awesome and customer service from start to finish was excellent. No assigned seating wasn’t an issue. Seats are fairly comfortable and at 6’4” I had enough leg room to be comfortable. Thanks Southwest!
"✅ Trip Verified |  Horrible, we booked as a family of 10, expected to get together, and paid more than the standard flight ticket. Unfortunately, we were displaced around the flight, and they had no priority. Never do any group booking and advertise to family and friends. It’s just like Spirit Airlines, but a little bit of cushion on the seat, free bags, and a couple more inches."
Not Verified |  Mary At customer service just hung in there throughout the worst cell phone reception I’ve experienced in my life ! to get our tickets done. Just incredible patient and determination. Pair that up with no luggage fee and no change fees I will never fly another airline as long as Southwest has the route!
"✅ Trip Verified |  On time departure and arrival notwithstanding a midflight medical emergency which appeared to have been resolved prior to landing in FLL. Outbound flight on 737-700 and inbound flight on 737-800. ICE worked flawlessly on both flights. On both flights, flight crew were courteous and provided the usual Southwest friendly no-frills service."
"✅ Trip Verified |  We had the worst flying experience of our life. We were greeted by employees who were completely unhelpful yelling at as for using the wrong kiosk and rather than help, made rude remarks. A lost every flight we were on got delayed. We flew out of the Philadelphia airport and showed up over 2 hours early for our flight the airport economy parking is partly shut down for rehab. There was zero signs to direct us to the new entrance we had to follow a shuttle bus after attempting to circle the airport 4 times. We made it to the check in with 45-50 min to take off. As I explained the south west employees treated us like trash. My wife is 28 weeks pregnant and was almost in tears. We missed our flight and the only decent employee we encountered was the one at the gate who quickly rebooked us."
"Not Verified |   A flight attendant was extremely rude to the elderly, wheelchair-bound passenger seated next to me for unzipping her dog's crate just enough for him to stick his head out. The crate was on the floor beneath the seat in front. Rather than politely telling her that the case must be fully closed, he treated her like a child and loudly demanded that she close it immediately. I was appalled that a Southwest employee would be so unnecessarily rude to a passenger."
Not Verified |  I always travel by Southwest and the treatment I received in Puerto Rico was the most unpleasant. I am disabled with a wheelchair and they treated me like garbage. It was the worst experience I have had with this company in the check-in area where people leave their luggage. Those who were there on Saturday at 3:30am should not be working with clients. The rest of the trip was very pleasant once we left Puerto Rico everyone was very friendly. Siempre viajo por Southwest y el trato que recivi en Puerto Rico fue el más desagradable soy impedido con silla de ruedas y me trataron como basura fue la peor experiencia que e tenido con esta compañia en el área de check in donde se deja el equipaje las personas que estuvieron allí el sábado a las 3:30am no deberían de trabajar con los clientes el resto del viaje fue muy agradable una vez salimos de Puerto Rico todos fueron bien amables.
"Not Verified |  Flight 623 from Phoenix to Greenville/Spartanburg with change in Atlanta on December 20, flight attendants perhaps do not like their job or had a bad day before, whatever, very unpleasant. Glad to have a different flight crew upon return."
"Not Verified |  We were gifted with a very professional and kind male purser (unfortunately I didn’t get his name) on Flight # 273, date travelled December 23rd, 2023; we have never seen such superb service on Southwest Airlines before. The kind and exemplary behavior towards the elderly was superb; we observed how patient and attentive he was to them as well as the other passengers; he even walked thru after serving us, to ask us if we were “OK” and needed any thing else. This was a true example of what great customer service should be and he should commended for his excellent service."
"✅ Trip Verified |   Round trip to DCA for a wedding. Both outbound and inbound flights were on 737-700. Outbound flight to DCA was uneventful. Smooth flight all the way to DCA. ICE worked flawlessly. There was plenty of legroom in Row 1. The only negative was the bathroom could have been cleaner. Inbound flight to DAL was delayed by about 25 minutes. The window seat in Row 1 is very uncomfortable. ICE worked fine on this leg too. Bathrooms were cleaner. On both outbound/inbound flights. On both flights, flight crew provided friendly, efficient no-frills service."
"Not Verified |   I purchased airfare for my family traveling with small children. I purchased early bird seating so that they would be able to sit together. I have since found out that there are boarding procedures which allow families to sit together. No early bird needed. It doesn't say this anywhere on the website. I asked that the early bird purchase be refunded. Nope, sorry, we don't do that. I am an a-list member and usually fly Southwest. Not anymore. I'm going for Delta."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Will never fly Southwest again after today. Awful! The people are rude. My dog was in her carrier the whole flight, when I got off the plane someone was waiting to talk to me. They accused me of having the dog out of the kennel the entire flight. I had a blanket on my lap and apparently thought it was the dog. Not one of the flight attendants came up to me and said anything about the dog during the flight. Accusing me and threatening me that they are going to have to file a report and I will not be able to fly a dog again. Sounds good to me because I will never choose Southwest for my travels need again."
✅ Trip Verified |  My wife and my 3 children traveled from Atlanta to Fort Lauderdale. The staff is very disorganized in Atlanta. I almost missed my flight because of them. We were going from Atlanta-Fort. Lauderdale-La Havana. Cuba. Nov 13. From Fort Lauderdale-La Havana. Cuba the attention was excellent including the aircraft staff
"Not Verified |  Never again! Don't fly Southwest out of Charlotte. No kiosks, you stand in line for an hour to get a boarding pass. 2 agents checking people in, which is absurd. I paid extra to board in A group, only to get on the plane to find people savings seats for others that didn't pay. No enforcement of that not being allowed.  Southwest sucks now."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Wife has panic disorder and was forced to sit apart due to the terrible first come seats Southwest Airlines does. I am flying on military orders and cannot upgrade. Every other airline allows me to use my DOD ID to board, but the staff taking boarding passes denied us and all wives. Worst customer service ever! I will never fly Southwest Airlines again no matter the cost."
"Not Verified |  We have always flown Southwest and love it, my only complaint is the luggage department. Every time we fly into New Orleans, we always have to wait 15-30 minutes for our luggage to come out. When we flew in yesterday into New Orleans, we waited 25 minutes for our luggage to come out but on a totally different carousel that it listed on the board. Someone is not doing their job, and I will not hesitate to switch airlines on future trips."
"Not Verified |   Absolutely horrible experience. After being delayed for 3 hours, the pilots said “sorry folks, we just don’t know why!” They separate families even who book together so my husband and I waited in line only for the gate agent to make me go alll the way to end of line because they grouped us separately…. Then I get on and the seats are unassigned so there is no luggage space in the right areas and my husband got yelled at multiple times for saving a seat - people from the back were coming from the front so a bunch of people had to basically sit in peoples laps for the back people who had no seats left to get by. Absolutely horrible experience and so unorganized."
"✅ Trip Verified | Southwest used to be the best value in the skies. Additionally, they had the friendliest employees. Neither of which is true anymore. I made A-Preferred and have 950,000+ miles, so it's not that I haven't given them a fair shot. The attendants who used to be warm and friendly, and make the standard safety messages amusing, have transformed into a surly bunch, who spend most of the flight on their phones I know it's a tough job and the number of crazies have gone way up, but when your plane staff is worse than United (and can't hold a candle to Delta) it says something."
"Not Verified |  We have been flying with Southwest for years, and are always pleased. The in flight service is excellent, the snacks are better than most airlines, seats are comfortable, and our flights have always been on time."
"Not Verified |  I flew a few times in the past and I was very happy till 2 days ago. From LAX to Oakland and it was just fine. Flying from OAK to Bellingham, we were assigned to term, 31. Kept on waiting for an hour. Noticed nobody showed up. I asked told me it was moved to term 25 which was quite a long walk. When we arrived ended up at the end of the line. They changed the plane and did not bother to inform us. The plane old with a very uncomfortable seat. E ded up near restroom. Open seating was a bad idea. I will not fly Southwest again."
✅ Trip Verified | Horrible. 3 hr delay. Arrived at 2 am TPA. No meal vouchers. Tracked this plane all day #1842 SWA. Den. Columbus. Dulles. Midway. KCI. On time all day long. Plane arrives in KC but wait now the TPA plane is in Long Beach 3 hrs away what happened Southwest? You found out you could fill a plane by delaying passengers 3 hrs? Your gate agents lie! Weather Nope. Control tower nope. Called them out and proved wrong. Oh yeah. Got a $100 voucher on a future delayed flight. Cost me that much in airport meals for 3 hrs. Checked into my TPA hotel at 3 am. Why bother when breakfast was served at 6 am. Not the old Herb Keller airline it used to be. Pay the extra and fly with an airline with an upgraded logistics. Terrible service.
"✅ Trip Verified |   The employees were rude when I was confused about checking in my bag after getting an earlier flight, even though the confusion was due to what they told me. They can't even be kind to people for one simple mistake."
"✅ Trip Verified |   Purchased the Early Bird check-in for our return flight to Maryland after we experienced to be the last one to board going to Florida. It’s our first time flying Southwest airline so we didn’t know about the seating, A,B C groups they have. So on our way back we got the A group this time upon purchasing the early bird check-in so we me and my husband got the 7 aisle seats which is good and got the window seat for me and my husband got the aisle seat. It was pretty good until when I wanted to use the lavatory but I saw a woman standing near the front seats waiting for the other lady to come out from the lavatory. And after that, when she had her turn, a man stands up same spot waiting for his turn. The flight attendant didn’t say anything to them that it’s not allowed to stand in front waiting. When it was my turn I was just standing maybe on the 4 or 5 aisle waiting so I can use the lavatory. Now here comes the flight attendant telling me that I can’t stand in the aisle waiting. The way she told me was very rude. And she even told me to use the one that is all the way to the back. And why would I go all the way to the back when I’m sitting near the front lavatory. Even my husband noticed how she looked at us when she passes by our aisle. The crew should treat everyone nicely on the flight and not just to certain passengers."
"✅ Trip Verified |   My flight itself was great. From Cincinnati to Chicago we were offered a snack and a drink. I had asked for a diet Coke. I didn't get mine. I was skipped on that one. I got a snack though. I just thought they were busy so I let it go. Then from Chicago to Memphis we were again offered a snack and what we wanted to drink. I got my snack but again, I didn't get my drink. Luckily, I had a 20oz in my pure. Although it was hot, at least it was wet. I watched the airline worker give two bags of snacks to customers. Not a bag, it was about estimated 20 or more in a bag. It was huge. I thought so if you tell them you like the snacks, they give you 20 or more bags for free! I had to let them know when I was getting off the plane not only did I not get my drink on either flight I was on today. I guess I just looked like I didn't or was thirsty! I have had much better service on different airlines. Southwest is a thumbs down for me."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight attendants misguided me with wrong info. Burbank Airport uses old fashioned, outdated multi-level and steep ramps. There is a shortage of jetbridges at Burbank. Southwest, the primary carrier there, uses the ramps daily for many of their departing and arriving flights. I have a neuro muscular disability and use a mobility device, a rollator. I leave the rollator at the entrance to the aircraft. The flight arrived at BUR. I asked a flight attendant for a wheel chair at aircraft entrance to avoid the steep ramp. The attendant insisted that there’s nobody to bring the wheel chair up the ramp, that I must walk down. He denied the request. So he lied on company policy. I told the attendant that there’s wheel chair assistance by Southwest employees for getting down using the ramp to the ground. Another flight attendant said I’ll walk you down. So she told me the wrong Southwest policy too. Then she changes the narrative and say’s I’ll get a wheelchair, after I raised safety concern. There are other airline choices besides Southwest. I will consider another carrier for the next trip, since safety is important, and don’t need any games from Southwest crew members."
Not Verified | I wanted to express my gratitude to Jose at customer service. I knew nothing about procedures for tickets and flying and Jose answered all my questions and walked me through the process. I'm elderly and he was so patient with me. Southwest is lucky to have an employee like Jose. He is the epitome of customer service.
"Not Verified |  I Fly fairly regularly with Southwest and up to now my experiences with them have always been very good. Usually a reasonable price, Always good and friendly people to help out when something goes wrong. I once missed my flight out of Orlando at Christmas time - I was horrified but they managed to get me on another flight and although I had been really upset they made me believe it was not a problem to them at all. So to return to yesterdays flight from Houston to Orlando. Everything about the flight was fine, on time, seating etc great. But I have to say the flight attendant was amazingly funny. Yes they are all amusing and make the journey a little more pleasant but this guy - Alex was his name, was hilarious! I don't know why he is working for the airline he would be great at stand up! Anyway Alex thanks for the fun- it was a delight to spend a little time with you!  This Flight was 407/363 from Houston to Orlando."
"Not Verified |  Customer Service was poor on my last flight. I was flying from Panama City to New York (LGA) with a connection in Nashville on a Saturday. My first flight was fine (in flight beverages and entertainment not great, but I have come to expect this with Southwest). My second flight got delayed 3/4 times before ultimately being cancelled at 8.30pm. Again, not usually an issue, but they were unable to rebook me until Monday. The service desk was not able to get me on a flight the next day at all and also wouldn't let me get on standby for any of the Sunday flights. I was willing to accept this, however, I had no place to stay in Nashville. When I requested a comped or discounted hotel room (especially considering I was going to need somewhere to stay for two nights) they declined siting weather as the reason for cancelation, therefore they didn't need to provide hotel accommodation. While I understand what's in their contract, it is an absolutely awful customer experience to be stranded in a city where you have no connections and are essentially forced to pay for a hotel or sleep in an airport for over 24 hours. I would have expected them to either pay for my hotel or try a bit harder to get my on a flight the following day and not two days later. When this has happened to me on other airlines, they have always provided a hotel room free of charge and tried their best to get me on a flight the very next day, regardless of the reason for the cancellation. I ultimately had to cancel my return flight and get a rental car to get myself home. (at an additional cost of several hundred dollars). I will think twice before booking with Southwest again. You could be out much more money than you planned if there is any unexpected weather."
Not Verified |  Southwest has become the absolute worst airline out there. Inexplicable delays; terrible customer service; all around horrible. Will avoid them at all costs in the future.
"Not Verified |  After being stuck in Baltimore for 6.5 hours and being lied to and no help or answers while wondering the airport with a one year old girl and two year old boy, we finally got to Buffalo and to our destination at 3:30 A.M. when we should have arrived at around 7:00 P.M. desperate to get the kids right to bed we learned  our luggage was ruined as if thrown in a pool because the airline left everyone's luggage in a very heavy rain. Medications were destroyed, study material damaged, sound machines ruined. Our luggage themselves smell now and are ruined, the list is long just to name a few. We filed a claim and the end result was "" because we did not file a claim within 3-4 hours our claim was denied and they want to stand by that. Almost $3,500 in damage and we got offered a $50 and $200 voucher (for their airline of course) which went to $100 after i replied unacceptable. I would avoid this airline or get insurance if you can afford it because we could not and this was the outcome and this airline avoids responsibilities they are at fault for."
"✅ Trip Verified | Outbound flight to FLL (737-800) was delayed by about 60 minutes. The flight was diverted to TPA to refuel because severe thunderstorms over FLL prevented aircrafts from landing. Flight finally landed in FLL at 02.20 am 3 hrs later than scheduled. The ICE worked flawlessly and I was able to watch a movie in its entirety thanks to the delay. The only negative: the plane wasn't cleaned properly. The trash bin in the forward lavatory was full and the paper towels needed replenishing. Inbound flight was on a 737 Max 8. Aircraft was very clean and there was plenty of legroom in Row 2. This is a quiet aircraft with curved overhead bins to accommodate all carry on luggage. On both flights, flight crew provided friendly, efficient no-frills service."
"Not Verified |  Horrible service, delayed, then delayed again. First time traveling with them and I will never make that mistake again. Claimed free wifi and movies as well and they didn't work for the flight. Do you self a favor and fly anyone else but them."
✅ Trip Verified |  Manu I don't know if you will see ever this but there are no words that shall forever express my gratitude for your aloha that got me home. You don't know but you saved and changed my path of life when you helped me that day. I am forever grateful for you being placed there on that very day.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I have always loved Southwest. Everyone in my family has flown frequently on Southwest for almost 30 years. But lately they are earning their terrible customer service reputation. Our flight was horribly delayed, I strongly doubted the excuses they gave for the delay, but was pleasantly surprised that each of us received a $250 travel voucher for our inconvenience. However, when we tried to use them, they had already been used by a travel agency in China under the name “Ted Williams.” They are giving away so many vouchers for their own bad behavior that Chinese hackers are stealing them. I complained about how obviously this was not me, but nothing. Southwest phone and online customer service could not care less. Thanks for treating me horribly, getting my hopes up, and then letting Chinese hackers take my voucher. Great airline you have there, Southwest. In the early 2000s, I have no doubt they would have honored my voucher, but they simply don’t value customers any longer."
"Not Verified | I am A-List Preferred. Southwest is a disappointment, but I don't think it cares. Under current management it is no longer customer friendly, its systems are antiquated and deficient, it is unreliable, it copiously blames weather to shield its shortcomings (which are many), and its employees are either disinterested or antagonistic. It certainly has earned its pathetic reviews by customers. Hopefully JetBlue will expand its operations westward."
"Not Verified | Always happy with Southwest. Love that baggage doesn't cost extra and seating is first come first serve. I recently read that they are also going to begin allowing to move flights around same day if a seat is available or go standby at no charge. This policy only makes sense, if room is available and customer is at the airport why not let them get on a sooner flight. Also takes the stress out of running into an accident on the way to airport and get there late (happened where I missed a flight and ended up driving because I missed my flight!). Over past couple years, I've probably flown 5 times and every flight was as expected. I like the assortment of drinks (alcoholic and non alcoholic) but wish they had better snacks. Oh and glad to hear internet equipped planes will begin offering free WiFi (if I heard correctly)."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Today I flew from Boston - Logan on flight #5231 to Chicago - Midway. The cabin staff service  is very bad service. I required want go to restroom a lot time but staff still refuse, she talk to me in a very annoying way. I ask her name, but she don't answer because she don't have the name on her uniform while another staff service work with her have a name. I think she needs a customer service course again or southwest airline doesn't need such a bad staff."
Not Verified |  Excellent customer service from flight attendants (very courteous). Pilot announcements were succinct and helpful. Comfortable flight overall and we landed a few minutes early.
"Not Verified |  Worst travel experience in my life! 3 of 4 legs of the trip were delayed by an hour or more. Delay of one portion caused me to miss my connecting flight, even though the staff knew that 2 of us travelers were delayed by SW. They closed the doors while they saw us running to the gate! Overall, my 4 hour flight was 21 hours to get home."
"Not Verified |  I almost always fly Southwest Airlines. I find them to be reliable and reasonably priced. I know what to expect in terms of uncomfortable seats and no food. My complaint is the growing number of pre-boarders. I pay extra for Business Select and a boarding number of 1-15. I'm not getting what I paid for when 30 (actual number on last flight) people pre-board ahead of Business Select. My solution is simple, board the 1-15 Business Select customers first, then the pre-boarders followed by the remaining passengers. If your concern is accommodating the legitimate wheel-chair passengers in the first row (bulkhead) simply block that row off. Charging extra for Business Class and not delivering 1-15 boarding as promised, if not fraud, is at least deceptive and leaves the Business Select customer feeling cheated."
"Not Verified |  Flight attendants were so rude! Flying out of a small airport in Eugene, Oregon after hiking and the flight attendants were yelling at everyone to sit down before boarding was even complete. Passengers had smaller items in overhead bins which did not allow guests with carry-on luggage enough space. Multiple people were told very rudely they would have to check their bags. This is ridiculous behavior when passengers have paid to carry on bags. Flight attendants should be doing their job by helping passengers, not berating and embarrassing them while they are trying to board. These two flight attendants need a serious course in customer service and how to treat passengers with respect. Appalling."
"Not Verified |  I flew southwest airlines for a business trip in Orlando. Although I had a ticketed flight the airlines bumped me to a later flight. They did offer me a voucher for the delay in getting to my destination. Once at the airport at my destination I was told that my luggage was still in Baltimore. As I had a meeting that evening I arrived late for the meeting and was not properly dressed to do my best. I stopped to purchase some necessary items. When my luggage finally arrived, I was told I would get a voucher if I picked up the luggage at the airport, otherwise they would deliver. I received the luggage the next day at 7pm when I got in from work. I told SWA that they should provide compensation for the inconvenience of not having my luggage or files until day 3. I entered a complaint as the inconvenience is going so long without my clothes for 30% of my work trip. They have not responded to my claim since. The inconvenience is not having my luggage and paperwork. SWA, choosing travel consumers want a reliable airline and who stands behind delayed luggage, whether we return to airport to pick up or have delivered. Very disappointing not to even get a response to my claim."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Very disappointed in the baggage attendant at San Antonio International Airport. At approximately I came to check in. After retrieving my luggage tag I proceeded to area to drop off bag. There were at least 3 attendants standing around with no customer. I just proceeded to first station. A  lady with a red Southwest Airline shirt on walked and rudely stated I needed to wait until the called me. I advised I wasn’t aware. I’m not too concerned about Southwest Airlines policies if any; however, it was the ladies attitude. Not only did she treat me with disrespect, not one time did she greet me properly, ask me to have a good day or anything. She even slammed my bag on the conveyor almost if she wanted to emphasize her point. I was merely flying home to memorialize my Dad who passed away, You never know what anyone is going through with and a kind word, act or deed could make that persons day better. I did not appreciate this woman talking to me in a condescending, rude tone. If she were in my shoes, she wouldn’t have appreciated it either! Again, I don’t know who this woman is but she is not a good representative for your company. I have been flying for years and have never encountered anyone who behaved in that manner."
"✅ Trip Verified |  This is the worst airline ever. The customer service is horrible. I thought people were joking when they said how bad Southwest is, no its true. Today my wife changed my original flight from yesterday to today,  and we couldn't cancel our original flight without choosing a replacement flight. So we got a confirmation email about canceling my original flight but no confirmation number about my new flight. After that we called customer service and they said they couldn't find my flight (even after we received our confirmation about my new flight). She was absolutely no help and basically told us to buy a brand new ticket to get home. Horrible service, I hate Southwest and I do not recommend flying this airline."
✅ Trip Verified |  1hr delayed arrival at Phoenix 1.5 hr delayed docking at the gate at Baltimore  3+ hr delay in getting luggage at baggage claims after arriving at the airport at 0100 am docking at 0230 and then not receiving bags at current time of 0435 AM. They have very poor customer service and it seems the airline is going down in quality. This was a horrible experience.
"Not Verified | I have flown Southwest since I was a child and I am always impressed by the witty flight attendants, flexible seating and free carry-on policy. But alas, I find myself disappointed and distraught yet again. As I write this, I am sitting on the plane because I find the time to act is now. No longer will I sit in the shadows and ignore this issue. There are too many pretzels in the snack mix. It's preposterous. When you hear the term snack mix, you can expect a medley of various chips, crackers and PERHAPS a few pretzels. But what I just ate has no right to be called a MIX. Pretzels plagued my small package and I was overwhelmed. I have fond memories of the old peanut and biscuits that used to be available. Why are they gone? We may never know. Also, though this has nothing to do with the airline, the person in front of me has chosen to recline their seat. Why was this even made an option? And who would do that? I am struggling to sympathize. Maybe I would feel better if I had a well-rounded snack mix in my belly. Thank you for reading, and gods speed to anyone who values the truth and hates false advertizing."
✅ Trip Verified | Awful experience all around. 2 hour delay. Slow getting people on the plane. Rude. Why does this airline constantly do this. I had to reschedule all my arrival accommodations.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I ordered two coffees, with three sugars each, repeated three times; I’m first row window seat on left behind door. The cabin steward hands me two coffees with three creamers each, no lids; and no tables to set them on. Why couldn’t lids be provided? It took three hours to get my first beverage, I’m up at 5 to make 630 flight, and coffee providers are closed. Thanks for really screwing up a mornings start. I also appreciate that Southwest wants my feedback. Click on the feedback tab to ask what did you use app for? I’d honestly like to know why I did too? Feedback is static, please make no comments; submit. You used to be low cost, now you’re a legacy carrier; and as soon as I’ve exhausted my points using my companion fare; your credit card goes in the back of dresser. So spent on the lesser quality of flying southwest now, used to be fun exuberant staff; but now they treat you like a McDonald's employee would treat you. All the draws that made me loyal are falling to the wayside. You can tell the employees look at this like a job instead of a career."
✅ Trip Verified |  I left my laptop on the plane. Darlene from Southwest baggage claim at Baltimore Washington international airport was incredibly rude and wouldn’t even let me finish my sentences. She literally kicked me out of the baggage claim (7/23/2023). I was not rude to her. It was purely one sided. Worst customer service I’ve ever gotten from an airline! No wonder Southwest doesn’t have a Google review option. They would be inundated with poor reviews about people like Darlene!
"✅ Trip Verified | I am writing as a concerned Officer in the United States Army. I usually only fly with United or American and took a chance with Southwest bc I needed direct flights for my kids. I have three children who need to fly to CA to be with family as needed, ages 5, 8, and 15. I’ve never bothered to do early check in bc I’m priority boarding but decided to do it this time since it’s w a different airline then what I’m use to. My youngest being a 5 year old girl was given a seat in C24 when her brothers were placed in C11 and C 12. So naturally I called the airlines. The lady said she couldn’t change her seat. I asked what about priority boarding for unaccompanied minors (the 8 and 5 year old) she shut that down. I explained I need my kids to sit together please. I asked about priority boarding for military. I explained they have military ID cards and I will have mine on me as I plan to wait with them at the gate to see them off. She said “Sorry but no priority boarding for them, we don’t do that.” She was so rude. I explained these kids are new to this routine and it is the 5-year old first time flying w/o mommy with her. The southwest rep could not care less saying that there’s nothing she can do for us! I was very angry. Seeing how less than 1% of the population serves our military one would think they would treat military members and/ or their kids better, especially with everything they go through. Southwest is not a military friendly airline."
"Not Verified | LAX-RNO. Only carry-on bags so no airport check-in needed. Thru TSA and right to the gate. Flight was about 30 minutes late but we were informed. 2230 hrs departure so airport fairly quiet. Plane arrived and departed super fast and was only half full of passengers which was nice. Standard beverage and snack offered. Crew were in a good mood as it was their last flight of the day. Smooth quick flight to Reno. Landed, exited and in our car all within 15 minutes. Southwest is always our first go to when flying in and out of Reno."
"I missed my flight so I went and got another ticket, that plane got cancelled, then get another new ticket and now it's been an hour delayed. I've been here since 4 am and won't get there until 8pm. Highly recommend you don't go through them and I asked if they would give me credit, they said no."
"Not Verified |  The day started with a notice while we were departing our cruise ship notifying us of a delay on our flight from Houston to San Diego. We noticed the change reduced our layover to 40 minutes, so we headed directly to the airport to give us time to resolve the conflict. We arrived 6 hours before our scheduled time, so I stood in line for over an hour to discuss the issue with the over-worked agent who told me that my best bet was to keep the schedule as she didn't see anything that was better. This phrase came up a lot, but their agents are clearly trained to tell clients that they don't have control of the weather, etc. regarding delays. The only flights from Southwest that were delayed were those to San Diego (it was not weather related as the flights to and from San Diego were also on schedule except ours). After waiting until we could check luggage (4.5hrs), we went through security to our gate only to see the delay had been extended (5 minute layover). Agent 2 told me that she could only find another flight with 1 seat headed to Boise, but she could only see Houston connections, so I called their 800 number. 3rd agent was an explanation followed by hold/hang-up. 4th agent was actually willing to change the flights to another option, but because we checked baggage #4 (the only person willing to help us) had to send me back to the terminal agents with the flight information. 5th agent is unwilling to change the flight because the plane from San Diego to Boise has 17 passengers and is going to wait for us. I asked if we could be boarded in front or so we could make our connection, but that would be unfair to everyone else, so we sat in the back. I knew I was being lied to, but at this point I figured I'd just wait to see what would happen. We fly to San Diego to find a nice message once we were off airplane mode about how our flight left and we were given new boarding passes for a later flight along with a $100 voucher for a later flight (YAY!). I looked at my pass and it was an ""A"" position which was nice and handed off the other 3 for our family to my wife and went in search of food (terminal was super crowded due to construction) so we grabbed some snacks and found a spot on the floor to sit. I mentioned how it was nice that we didn't get boarded last and my son tells me his pass was C-30 and his girlfriend was C-15. I took our passes to the 7th agent (6 was for new passes) and expressed that it was ridiculous that my family was not set to board together. She immediately went off about how unfair it was for other passengers. I stated that my original tickets were in the A group for that leg of the flight (in an irritated voice), but she stuck to her argument. At this point, I was done with their service, so I expressed to her that I had spent the better part of 12 hours trying to get them to correct the issue and completely ignored. She threatened me regarding getting on the plane and finally got me a supervisor. The supervisor #8 and I had a long discussion regarding the situation and continued down the road of unfairness, but she would allow us to board together. She mentioned the $100 vouchers, but why would I ever fly with them again - I'd pay not to (and told her so). She also asked why I didn't ask for a supervisor - Isn't that their job when they can't help a customer? Flying with Southwest is just not worth the trouble. They get a 2 rating because their flight staff is actually amazing!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Mine are psychiatric service dogs and even though I presented the DOT form requested with my medical letters the attendant said that my dogs are not considered service dogs, that he was letting it go this time but there would not be a next time. My dogs travelled to Puerto Rico from Tampa and I did not have any issues, and they have been traveling with me for the past 7 years without any issues. While at the boarding gate my whole name was called out through the intercom, I raised my hand and an agent came over to ask me if my dogs were well behaved."
"Not Verified |  RNO-LAX via San Jose. No checked baggage, just carry-on so checked in online and off to the gate. TSA in Reno has the new scanners so you don't have to remove your electronics from your baggage. Nice! Flight was running 30 minutes late but we were well informed of this. Light passenger load to San Jose so room to move around. Usual beverage and snack service. Quick stop in San Jose was lengthened to an extra 30 minutes as waiting for arriving passengers to board from another flight. it was understandable as it was about 20 passengers. Still a light load with only half the seats filled onwards to LA. Another beverage and snack service. Arrived into Los Angeles about half an hour late. From landing to driving out of the airport was only 20 minutes so made up time that way. All in all a good experience with pleasant flight and ground crew. As usual we have the best luck with Southwest out of Reno."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Southwest Airlines has become a joke. Flight delays and connections that make no sense. I used to enjoy the airline but now, I loathe this company. They have no sense of customer service and they don’t care about their employees because the employees don’t care about the customer. They get paid before they render you any sort of service but when that service is less than what you expected they they take their time about rectifying the problem.  Flight delays because of staffing shortages are a poor excuse for an so-called major airline."
"✅ Trip Verified |  With no assigned seating 12 people took advantage of wheelchair pre boarding. If it was legit it would be one thing but several of these people sprung up while waiting for the plane to arrive to use the rest room and walk all the way to find snacks in the gift store, obviously no issues walking when it was convenient for them. I will walk across the country before I ever fly SouthWest again!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I only flew Southwest once many years ago before flying with Southwest during the Christmas holiday in 2022. My first flight was booked by a corporate travel agency and that is why I flew Southwest years ago. I was among the thousands of travelers who were stranded during the last week in December 2022. I thought Southwest was genuinely trying to make things right with travelers by offering 25,000 reward points, When I went to redeem the points, I was shocked to learn that they had expired because I did not redeem them by March 31, 2023. If the points are not supposed to expire, why have a deadline to redeem the points? This tactic solidified my initial gut feeling about Southwest. I will never fly them again!"
"Not Verified |  I was given a boarding pass for gate C 25 at Denver International Airport two hours before my flight. I get there and they tell me the gate has been changed to C 63. I am recovering from a pelvis fracture and knee replacement so can’t walk that fast anymore. I get to C63 and the plane is still sitting there, but they gave my seat away. As though the ticket I purchased doesn’t count for anything! Now my luggage is going to an airport I know longer have a flight to. After the fact, they text me about a flight to another airport later in the day. So clearly they could have texted me when they changed the gate, but didn’t. This is how they treat their customers. I’d rather not fly than ever have anything to do with Southwest Airlines again. They don’t deserve to be in business."
Not Verified |  The flight was late. The ground staff could not verify who was on the flight and they seemed confused. The staff went through the cabin of the plane with the manifest asking for everyone to give their name so they might verify what was going on. Very unprofessional with absolutely no consideration for the time of their customers.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked this flight as it was the only option for a last minute need. The first leg was delayed hours, the second leg delayed twice as long only for them to cancel the flight altogether after midnight when no adequate customer service was available to handle the situation. The reason for cancellation was no pilot. Why on earth was a flight scheduled without staff? Southwest then had the audacity to reschedule me on their own flight 24 hours later (without asking) with an itinerary that would involve another long layover. What a joke. I booked an early AM one-way ticket with an airline that isn't garbage (Delta)"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight attendant was saving good seats for people that she decided she wants. Many people (not just my group) tried to sit in the seats but she blocked the seats with her body and gave all kinds of excuses as to why each person shouldn’t sit there. When she saw people that she liked, she unblocked the seats and told them to sit there. I don’t know how she decides who deserves the good seats, but i paid $100 for Earlybird check in (me and my wife) so that we would have choice of the better seats. Two other people in my group upgraded for the same reason but they couldn’t get the seats either. And one of those people have hip, knee and back issues and upgraded so that he would have a chance at the good seats (two knee replacements, one hip. replacement and multiple back surgeries) The whole point of paying extra/upgrading, is to get those seats. I feel jipped. And I really hate to say this but there was some kind of favoritism going on.  Furthermore there was another flight attendant that many people said was rude and condescending. People throughout the flight were trying to get to the front lavatories. The 2 rude flight attendants told several people that the restroom was closed. I understand that they were working in that area preparing our drinks and snacks, but they were very rude to my wife and several others when telling them to go use the other lavatories. I was sitting near the front with my wife and we watched these 2 flight attendants throughout the flight. Everyone sitting near us was watching and talking about the situation too. There was one flight attendant that was very kind and polite though."
"Not Verified |  I never write reviews but this experience was so tragic for me I felt like I needed to let off some steam. Some backstory - I just graduated college and am supporting my fiancé as he finishes college. After doing year-round school, I have about $2,000 to my name in addition to student debt I still owe. Since we are paying for our own honeymoon, we wanted something very affordable. We were planning on just going somewhere local when my fiancé's parents shared a 48 hour deal for Southwest tickets to go to Hawaii. They offered roundtrip tickets to 4 islands for under $350. We were ecstatic! Since my fiancé was saving for a ring I was in charge of purchasing the flights. I hurried to purchase them but then we found out housing was pretty expensive so we switched out flight to another island on the deal. Little did I know switching made the deal invalid. This wasn't mentioned in the email. I did notice it cost extra but thought the deal was still on there so the total couldn't be too much (this was my first time scheduling a flight and I was under time pressure so I was a bit naïve). After paying the difference, I looked a the confirmation email and saw that the total was $1250! I was working so I rushed to an office and got a hold of customer service and they told me that piece of information about changing flight locations. Apparently a lot of people were experiencing the same issue. I started crying explaining that I had no idea the deal wasn't applied and if there was any way I could get my money back. They said that if I canceled I could only get flight credit. I hung up and called my fiancé right away. I was bawling my eyes out explaining how I had messed up our honeymoon and we could never afford the trip at full cost. After that phone call I had to go back to work like everything was okay. I know I was a bit naïve but I still feel scammed out of my honeymoon. Please be careful trusting any deal Southwest Airlines promotes because there's probably a catch somewhere."
"Not Verified | Canceled flights after making everyone wait both in the boarded plane that wasn't moving for 4 hours (with AC off) took us off and told us to wait, 4 hours later they canceled the flight and did not give us food or a place to stay until the next available flight (all the ones for the rest of the evening were already booked)."
"Not Verified |  Treated very badly re: damaged luggage. My (almost new) bag was destroyed. I reported it at the airport and followed up as requested, via their portal. First was offered a travel voucher. Don’t want that. Then I was asked for a receipt for the purchase. I replied that it was a gift I received 2 months ago. Do not have a receipt. I provided the cost for an exact replacement . Then I was offered a very depreciated amount. I asked how they came to that amount (formula - age, cost etc). They did not reply. I called to try to escalate this issue several times. Phone agents were of no help at all. Just said work thru the portal. After a month I was told they would no longer reply to me and my case was closed. Very poor customer experience. I think my request was very reasonable. I didn’t even ask for dry cleaning reimbursement for some of my clothes inside that got wet and dirty. It was raining in Denver. I would NEVER fly with them again."
"✅ Trip Verified | Upon family boarding my daughter and I sat in the first 2 rows of the aircraft, we boarded the plane early. I put both our carry ons above us. I was soon interrupted by an un-helpful, nasty flight attendant stating you need to get you bag up or I have to check it. I quickly got my bag in and it fit fine, the woman watched me struggle with no help. Then after the plane had fully been boarded someone boarded the plane that also wanted their carry on to fit, my bag was then removed and placed further in back to place their bag where mine was. After drinks were served my daughter and I weren’t able to finish our drinks as a different flight attendant wanted to take our garbage and said we weren’t allowed to finish our drinks. When we were leaving the plane I asked the flight attendant where my bag was and I was told they didn’t know, and now I we had to wait until the entire aircraft un-boarded so I could get my bag. Once I was able to locate my bag it was in the exact position it originally was in but further back in the aircraft. My daughter and I were treated very poorly as we exited the aircraft by the flight attendant with a snarky, condescending tone “have a nice day”. Not sure how I feel about flying Southwest anymore with my family. We spent a lot of money on tickets and if we boarded early our bags should have had priority over the late comers and we should have been able to finish our drinks, and throw the garbage out when ready."
"Not Verified |  Constant delays with Southwest! When it's their fault, they punish you (customers) like we're in the wrong! A exlso, if I pay for a ticket with a certain seat number, I want to sit in that seat! What's the point of purchasing a ticket if it's always open seating! I think that's very unfair and it takes away from customers who purchase a ticket with certain expectations! I recently flew swa and was very upset because again, I paid for a ticket and almost didn't get a seat. If I purchase a ticket for a seat, I want to sit in that seat period! Open seating is stupid! Especially when you have a full flight. Very it together SW!!"
"Not Verified |  I fly Southwest every 3 weeks from Denver to Albuquerque on business. The last 8 times the return trip from ABQ to DEN has been delayed or cancelled. Southwest uses every excuse in the book, mostly weather related. These are lies. One flight, where we were 5 hours late getting into Denver, the captain blamed a tornado near DIA. The groundspout (basically a whirlwind) happened at 4:30pm and was 15 miles from DIA. We landed in Denver at about 1:30AM the next morning. Nothing but lies! Last night we were running about 1 hour late (as usual!) When we arrived at the gate we sat in the plane for 10 minutes while the gate agent chewed the fat with a friend ( in her case it was alot of chewing!) and then decided to wadle down the jetway and unlock us. After all why hurry for 120 people waiting in a plane. Unfortunately Southwest and United are the only airlines offering nonstop service between ABQ and DEN. I have been a loyal customer of Southwest for over 20 years and have accumulated several hundred thousand Rapid Rewards miles which I have used. No More! Bye Bye Southwest!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew out from Denver International to Fort Myers, Florida with my 2 young great grand kids. For verification I asked an off duty Flight Attendant what gate we were to fly out of. She looked at my ticket and told me C25 and pointed. We made our way over with me hobbling in horrible pain as it was hard to walk. As it got closer to the time to board I didn't notice any signs of Ft. Myers, Florida so I went to the desk and asked the gentleman what was going on. He looked at my ticket and said I misread it and that my gate was C64 - the opposite end of the airport. We took off at a dead run and ran the whole way even through 3 conveyor walk ways while he radioed ahead that ""there's a woman and two children running your way."" All I could think about was making this flight. As I got closer I heard 3 times, ""Flight 1383 to Fort Myers is fully boarded and if you want to make this flight then you need to come now or the door would be permanently locked."" I was frantic. When we got there the gal taking the ticket asked me how I felt and that I was blue around my mouth and she needed me to get stabilized with oxygen before she would let me on the plane. I received oxygen for about 10 - 15 minutes then boarded. Two flight attendants not only held the plane for me but saved me 3 seats together in the back of the plane. I've only flown Southwest except for one time with Frontier. I will always fly Southwest. I love Southwest and their cancellation policy, baggage perks and loyalty points with my membership. Thank you to the flight attendants for helping me in this pinch. You were so compassionate and helpful, above and beyond the call of duty. You are assets to Southwest. Thank you to the Pilot and other crew members. I hope I didn't cause anyone to miss a connecting flight as we were delayed."
"Not Verified |  Allow me to share my recent experience that left me deeply disappointed. My boarding pass clearly stated that I needed to be on the plane by 3:20 PM, as the scheduled departure time was 3:32 PM. However, due to the disorganized nature of the TSA, it took an astonishing 45 minutes for me to place my personal belongings on the tray for scanning. To compound the situation, the TSA officials encountered difficulties while scanning my daughter's belongings. As I anxiously watched the clock, it took them an additional 20 minutes to complete the task. Finally, I arrived at the gate at 3:13 PM, a respectable 7 minutes before the designated boarding time mentioned on my boarding pass. To my dismay, however, the door had already been closed, and I, along with approximately 8 other passengers who had faced similar delays with TSA, were denied boarding. Consequently, I missed my flight to Ft Lauderdale and had to hastily book a flight to Orlando at 7 PM, which landed at 10:30 PM. On top of that, I had to endure a tiring 2.5-hour drive to WPB, knowing that I had work the next day. As a frequent traveler, missing a plane was a first for me, and it has left me with a strong resolve never to fly with Southwest again. What truly bewilders me is the stark contrast in treatment when delays occur. On numerous occasions, I have arrived on time only to experience flight delays for various reasons. As customers, we are expected to accept such inconveniences, but the differential treatment when delays happen to us is disheartening. Southwest has unequivocally lost my business. To add insult to injury, I had to personally retrieve my luggage from the Ft Lauderdale airport since I was not eligible for free delivery. This entire experience has further deepened my dissatisfaction."
"Not Verified |  Totally disappointed in SWA, they left us on the tarmac 35 min after we were supposed to depart Reno. I checked 2 bags in Reno, only 1 made it to Tulsa. This is Sunday, then they tell me “it might be in at 12.30 am.” Now the airline industry is supposed to be the most reliable industry in America. In fact, they train others on reliability. To make matters worse, if it comes in tonight at 12.30 am, they will get it to me “Tuesday” but who knows when. Step it up SWA, American has you beat, they put it on a delivery truck at 6am the next morning. Huge inconvenience as I am a travel Nurse, but my bag isn’t important right, not to SWA."
"Not Verified |  Not on time. Delayed due to overlapping flights and passengers trying to make it from far gates. Genuinely just sick of Southwest in overall preference. Their reward program is not worth a grain of salt. A-list priority is a joke, you share the same seating as those that have no interest or desire due to few times flying or something similar. Luggage cabin space is all you receive if you can't complete the requirements of spending goals or flying frequently. There is no such thing as ""first class"" treatment, even the companion pass is whatever."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Southwest has had major delays on my past four flights over three years. Something always goes wrong. We missed our flight, but their delay on the previous flight, by twenty minutes and Southwest couldn’t provide another flight for us home until 1:00 am the next day. We had to get a hotel and rent a car to drive home out of our own pockets. I hate this airline. Unless you are doing a straight through flight don’t even bother. Everyone I talk to has the same experience with them as well. If they would increase their layover times it would fix some of these issues."
Not Verified |  We had the nicest smoothest mid morning flight from Orlando to Aruba and afternoon flight back on May 11th and May 17th. Staff was very friendly going down. Very helpful and always smiling. Flight was on time going and returning. Told the pilot at the end of the trips that it was a nice flight and we’re very appreciative. The system for boarding needs to be controlled more in Orlando. It seemed to be in disarray at times. The system in Aruba was handled and controlled very well making sure people weren’t trying to get on ahead of others who were supposed to be boarding first. Hopefully this non-stop flight will continue. Flew it before in the past and happy they got it back again in early 2023. Thank you.
Not Verified |  Eric Michaelson was a one of the best air flight attendants I have the experience. I was feeling ill and he went above and beyond to make the flight enjoyable. He went out of his way to offer me a beverage to settle my stomach due to the turbulence. His customer service and professionalism was outstanding. I wanted to thank you as my airline of choice.
"Not Verified |  I am handicapped in that I have significant arthritis in just about every joint and am 85 years old. I asked for a wheelchair when I booked the flight, as I always do. This time when I arrived at the airport in Philadelphia to return home (this was a round trip booking) I checked in at the counter and reminded them that I had signed up for a wheelchair. She told me to sit down and one would arrive. This seemed normal as I have always traveled on Southwest and this was the routine. Well, I sat there for over half an hour, periodically asking a variety of Southwest personnel about the wheelchair. They said it was ""on the way"". When my plane was scheduled to board in 10 minutes I began to panic. When I asked at the desk again, the woman said, ""why don't you just walk?"" I was beginning to think that they thought I could walk to the gate and through security and were not going to provide the wheelchair I needed. At that point I saw a person with a wheelchair and no one in it. I asked her if she could take me to my gate as the plane was about to board and she said she ""worked for ...... airline and couldn't take southwest passengers"". Then she said that If I could walk to the nearby elevator she could take me. She told me not to get into the wheelchair until the elevator door closed and then she took me to the gate. The plane was boarding. It was very clear that, had I not approached this person and practically begged her to take me, I would have missed my plane, my connecting flight and heaven knows when I could have gotten home. This would be a disaster for me given my inability to navigate myself anywhere except short distances, not to mention what to do with my dogs at home whose sitter had to leave for another job. I am disgusted with Southwest and I never thought I would say this, but there is no excuse for what was just totally ignoring my disability needs. When I called southwest to complain they said they could file a report internally but they were not under an obligation to provide a pusher for a wheelchair (in this case there was no wheelchair OR pusher) and I know that's not true. If they don't want to provide this service it should not be offered when I book the flight. Then I would go to another airline. Also, when the person behind the desk told me ""to just walk to the gate"", it was clear that they were not taking my disability seriously and really had no intention of helping me."
"✅ Trip Verified |  One way ticket from Orlando to Raleigh on Memorial Day (I flew Avelo on 5/26/23 one way to MCO) on one of their older 737-700s. People like to rag on them for last year’s meltdown and other things but they have come roaring back on one of the busiest holiday periods. Virtually all of the incoming and departing flights out of the SWA terminal in OIA were on time—two delays tops—today. Boarding process was more orderly than Avelo’s (and quicker), left early and arrived early. Dependable service is what I get at SWA."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I can’t fly to Chicago for two days due to a rescheduled flight. For the first time we got on a plane and everyone just dropped us off and said that you were leaving tomorrow, and the next day they promised a direct flight to Chicago, but again they outplayed everything and changed the flight 3-4 hours before departure! Now I need to fly with a transfer to Dallas. I paid money for this! Is this an airline or a taxi on call? If you are saving your time, don't fly with this airline."
"✅ Trip Verified |  My flight was supposed to leave at 10pm. It is now scheduled to leave at 1:19am. Over 3 hrs delayed and there is no rain, wind, or any other explanation for the delay. The cost of this flight was ridiculously expensive, but being with family, due to a death in the family left no choice for travel dates and time. The airport staff say this is a regular thing with Southwest. What happened to the excellent service Southwest was once known for? I can now look forward to little or no sleep before work tomorrow. This has been my worst flight ever!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I am quite disappointed with Southwest. I and several members of my company have been flying Southwest for the past several years because the service and convenience had been exemplary particularly when taking into account the reasonable pricing. I have seen its attributes in many way degrade and some of the competitors improve their standards. I was particularly dismayed after having left my briefcase and phone on a flight on May 16th, 2023. After filing a lost report soon after deplaning, I received no helpful assistance from the airline other than an email three days later stating that they were looking into it and should consider the case close if no further notice had been received withing 30 days. Misplacing a phone these days does not only cause a significant financial impact but the information contained may be critical. For this reason, a more definitive answer than the nonchalant response from Southwest baggage supervisor at Midway Airport stating that they would be drowned in lost items that they receive daily then added 40-50 things including I-Pads, phones, and other items. This statement struck me as particularly irritating since the two individuals at the office were sitting without no apparent task at the time. With the concern that she displayed, I must conclude that the case is probably lost and that the decision to purchase another phone (regardless of cost) should be undertaken. I would have hoped that they might ask me to text my phone to more quickly identify the fact that they may or may not have it in their procession now at the Alabama location where all the lost items from all the Southwest flights go (now many thousands of items per day instead of 40-50). I will remember the lack of concern from Southwest me and my company employees fly in the future."
"Not Verified |  I recently had the misfortune of flying with Southwest Airlines, and I must say that my experience was nothing short of a disappointment. From the moment I stepped foot onto their plane, it was evident that this airline lacks the professionalism and commitment to customer satisfaction that one would expect. First and foremost, Southwest Airlines had no regard for punctuality. My flight was delayed once, and then they decided to rebook it for an unreasonably early hour in the morning. This unexpected change disrupted my entire travel plans and left me feeling exhausted before I even boarded the aircraft. It is unacceptable for an airline to make such drastic alterations without a valid reason or proper compensation. To make matters worse, Southwest's servers seemed to be in a state of disarray. Throughout the booking process, I encountered multiple technical glitches and slow response times on their website. It was frustrating to witness a company of this scale failing to maintain their online infrastructure, leading to additional stress and wasted time on my end. The flight itself was another disappointing aspect of my experience. The plane's condition was subpar. Southwest Airlines made a promise to compensate me for the inconvenience caused by their multiple delays and rebooking. They specifically mentioned a $200 voucher, which I was eagerly looking forward to. However, even after reaching out to their customer service department, I was met with indifference and received no resolution. It is disheartening to be on the receiving end of such false promises, especially when they have a direct impact on the customer experience. In conclusion, my experience with Southwest Airlines was marred by their unprofessionalism, lack of punctuality, technical glitches, and broken promises. I strongly advise potential travelers to consider alternative options and avoid the frustrations and disappointments that come with flying this airline. Southwest Airlines has left a sour taste in my mouth, and I can confidently say that I will not be choosing them for any future flights."
"✅ Trip Verified |  In 2007 Southwest served: 64.9 million cans of soda, juices, and water 11.3 million alcoholic beverages 6.1 million bags of pretzels 103.8 million bags of peanuts 14 million snackpacks 32 million other snacks Just think how much money Southwest would save if they stopped offering all those ""free"" drinks but then the public would go crazy.  Our beverage service has been canceled on probably 8 out of the last 10 flights I have been on.  And no I don't fly the same place so its not likely due to a specific route. But - if you do the math - Southwest is lost a TON of money due to the Christmas Flight debacle last year.  An average soda costs about $0.75 - $1.00 for the airlines, once you factor in the cost of the drink itself (they purchase cans), the cup, and the ice (which isnt much).  On average a flight has about 150 passengers - that's easily $112 - $150 they can put in their pocket when they ""cancel"" beverage service - and that's assuming each passenger only has one drink. On a recent flight (the one I'm on as I write this) - we were once again denied this ""freebie"" service in the name of supposed ""turbulence"" despite a relatively smooth flight.  I've heard others mention that the captain is the one who makes that decision, so I asked. When I asked about this, instead of simply answering my question, letting me know that the captain made the decision, etc. the flight attendant said something like ""let me find out"".   A few minutes later, the captain came on and ""explained"" why he felt it was important to cancel service - essentially providing an excuse for why they did this.  When I asked for the captain's name, so i could verify this with SWA customer service, I was met with another flight attendant who basically told me ""were not going to do that"" and refused to give me his name. He also threatened that they would ""divert the plane""  although I was extremely calm and was seated in my seat, not yelling or anything.  I guess I was talking loud enough for other passengers to hear - can't have more than one passenger figure out the little secret. Although I dont know what they are so worried about.  Most of the passengers on the plane will never even tell their friend or a significant other about the experience, let alone do anything that could actually make a difference (like report this on social media or via customer service). But still you dont have to ""hide"" and refuse to provide your name if you aren't doing anything wrong.  So this is all being done in the name of ""safety"" - lets go with that."
"Not Verified |  Granted flights were delayed, so the SW terminal was packed. However, my flight was on time. Because of the droves of people around the woman calling out boarding information, I could not hear her. She used a tiny microphone which actually none of us could hear. She then chose to yell out information which no one could hear either. Being my first time flying SW, I unfortunately, hadn’t researched how they board people. I had no idea where “C” was and asked around to finally find where my boarding area was. There was a fellow “C” woman who moved around, so I followed her. She said that since “A loaded, C could now line up.” It was then I figured out what the other number was on my ticket- so I lined up in that spot that was on a sign. As I got on the plane, I asked the flight attendant how I get a seat, “you just chose anything open.” I had no idea. And I had checked my boarding pass and even “pre-boarded.” How did I miss this information? It truly was a cattle call boarding experience. Luckily there were some very nice people to help me along in the boarding process as to where to go. What a joke. What has happened to public transportation?"
"Not Verified |  Southwest - maybe fly, maybe not. The gambling of your Vegas trip starts the moment you book a Southwest flight. Will you actually get there, or will they cancel your flight? Well, I am not lucky in cards - so my flight got cancelled just because. No inclement weather, no real reason. Just the fact that Southwest is incapable of doing their job of scheduling and has no care for their passengers time nor plans. So what they refunded the money? That’s not what I was looking for - I was looking to see my friend and make memories. But their rebooking is just ridiculous. Delaying my weekend trip until Saturday night, no other options, no other compensation. They are professional at cancelling flights without a second thought and then basically insulting you with their rebooking. I will never book Southwest again, I would rather invest in a reliable airline to actually get to my destination. Now I have a ruined vacation I was looking forwards to for my first mother’s day and my only option was to cry about it."
Not Verified |  Once again Southwest proves it is incapable of getting me to my destination in a timely manner. After cancelling my flight I rebooked only to be delayed twice and left hanging in Burbank.
"✅ Trip Verified | I normally really enjoy flying Southwest, but over the last year or so I have acquired a bad taste for them. I flew 11 May 2023 from BWI to Tulsa through St. Louis and I paid for Business Select so I could be in the first boarding group. When I checked in I was A01, which would mean I could get to my choice seat early and get my bag in an overhead bin. Yet there were 20 pre boarders on the first leg and 18 on the second leg - many who walked into the plane (only 5 wheel chairs total) The boarding process has become a joke as pre boarders, sit in the front 3-5 rows. So I think I'm going to request that every time I fly now because I pay $100 or so extra to get first choice of seat and overheard, yet that is no longer available because ALL pre borders have forced those who pay extra to sit in what's left. Sad thing is, many were able to walk to bathroom, get their luggage in and out of the overheads without issue. Southwest needs to recognize those who pay extra for their seats choice and have anyone who wants to pre board be required to sit in the back of the plane."
Not Verified | Horrible customer service. Ridiculous boarding policy. Will never fly again. I do not recommend. Pick any other economy airline and have a better experience.
"Not Verified |  Southwest has terrible scheduling, delays, being late causing lay overs. What does it honestly take to get a schedule correct, not having hours of delay. No more Southwest for me and my family."
"✅ Trip Verified |  SouthWest has left my wife and I stranded in Seattle on our way to our honeymoon to Bali. Flight changes for our international flight now cost 5K and southwest says they are not responsible for flight delays and inability to get me to my destinations on time! I have never had such a negative overall experience during my travels that I had to take a moment just to air out the grievance at 4AM while still traveling.  A short hour flight became a 3-hour overall flight due to inclement weather and being re-routed to Grand Rapids Michigan. I understand that inclement weather cannot be controlled and safety is priority. One would assume as a purchaser of a connecting flight that when a portion of that flight is off schedule the airline will adjust as needed to still get the customer to their destination in a timely manner. I was not given any reasonable options as I was on my way to catch an international flight to Bali, Indonesia and had to be in LAX by 4AM, I was given a ticket to get into LAX at 9:30AM. Adjustments were made to get me flown to Seattle after waiting all night to get my bags in order to re-check them I was treated extremely poorly by the check-in bag personnel who was training another employee. She was very curt, abrasive, dry, and mean. When I brought it to her attention that I had been stuck awake in the airport all night and that I did not appreciate her demeanor she brushed it off and continued in a very aggressive energy to nitpick anything i said or did, such as placing both bags on the scale after the first one had been weighed. When I again emphasized the poor fashion in which she was treating me she said she ""refused to serve me any longer"" which to my knowledge is only acceptable in scenarios of disrespect and while i felt severely disrespected by her treatment of my person, I did not act in any disrespectful fashion toward her. I am distraught as a whole at the incredibly poor showing Southwest is giving me during my travel toward my honeymoon with my wife who lives apart from me due to our work as physicians."
"Not Verified | Southwest continues to be our go-to airline with 12 roundtrips this year so far. The service, price, baggage policy, and cancellation/change policy cannot be touched by any other airline. The price cannot be matched by any other airline. After looking at other options, I cannot fathom why anyone wouldn't choose Southwest first. We love em."
"Not Verified |  A great experience, amazing flight attendants on both flights. Flights on time a lot of positive energy.. As a 10 year plus loyal customer that's our only airline."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Normally fly with United Airlines but decide to try SouthWest airlines since Military Fare discount when you call. So far United is better when it comes to boarding for military first. Military boards after A group on Southwest Airlines. I will probably just go back to United Airlines, unless United Airlines doesn’t do military fare discount."
"Not Verified |  I left my carry on bag at the passenger pickup in Las Vegas. Southwest Airlines Baggage Claim not only secured my bag, but went above and beyond to send it to me in St George within 2 days at no charge to me. They were so kind and considerate! Thanks again."
"Not Verified |  I had a horrible trip. I booked a trip from Oakland Ca. to Savannah Ga. in Nov. 2022. I HATE flying early, so I booked a flight that had a reasonable, late-morning departure and paid the extra money for a better schedule. About a week before my trip in April of 2023, Southwest canceled my flights and rebooked my whole trip. So, I had to get up at 3.30am to be at the airport by 4.30am for my new take-off time of 5.55am. Exactly what I didn't want and paid extra to avoid. There was no refund for my extra payment when they forced me onto the early undesirable schedule. Then.... On my return home from Savannah, our plane was delayed taking off at the Savannah airport. It turns out the fuel truck for our plane didn't have enough fuel in it. Seriously. So they went and got more fuel and then refuelled our plane which caused a delay to our connection in Houston. We would have had 9 minutes (given the delay for fuelling) to catch our flight in Houston, but Southwest elected to keep the plane to Oakland on time and leave us behind. Great. Now we are rebooked through Southwest for a flight the next day and we are in Houston overnight. And guess what? I have to get on a plane at 6.15am which is exactly why I paid extra money for my original schedule to avoid. The representative at the Houston airport was really nice (Angie G.) and we got a hotel voucher and a $200 Southwest voucher. But this just isn't enough. I'm arriving 16 hours late. I'm staying in a city overnight that I don't care to be in, and cutting my sleep for the second time in a week to keep a flight schedule that I didn't authorize or sign up for. I paid my pet sitter $200 to stay the night in my home and take care of my pets unexpectedly for the extra night. Where is the actual compensation for the 16 hours of my life that I spent overnight in Houston? I had to eat. I had to pay my pet sitter. I lost sleep and essentially, I lost an entire day of rest at home before my work week. This is just awful. I don't know what is going on with this airline, but I have no interest in your voucher to plan a trip with you ever. So......maybe it's time to think about what is actually fair in this awful situation that you created?"
"Not Verified | Flight was uneventful. Pleasant. Upon landing at my connection no wheelchair was there for me. And it is in my file too have one. SW ticket agent said wait and one will come to get me. After about 10 minutes I knew I wouldn't have enough time to get to my connecting flight. I found a wheelchair and walked pushing the wheelchair towards my connecting gate which was at the farthest end of the airport last gate. A SW employee saw that I was struggling and had me sit in the wheelchair and he took me the rest of the way to the gate. He wasn't called he just saw that I was having a hard time. I'm traveling again on the 3rd and I thought I should call and make sure wheelchair will be at my gate so I called customer service spoke with a lovely lady. I did not complain about what happened (no one for me there at the gate) but I thought I better call and make sure that doesn't happen again. She was so nice she told me what to do so this doesn't happen again. I felt really cared for and I could tell she was making sure it was clearly in my file. FYI, I may not look handicapped, because I try hard not to. But I cannot stand for very long, definitely can't carry much weight because server double scoliosis, both knees bone on bone and osteoarthritis back, knees, shoulder and hip. This is nobody's business at I don't have to say what my handicap is. If one person reads this and ""gets it"" well, I'll consider that one less person in the world that won't look at wheelchair person like their just trying to slip the line or get a better parking space. Just remember when you see someone in a wheelchair, who gets in and out of it, remember you don't always ""see"" what their going through. I would rather be standing and waiting instead of be getting in a wheel chair in pain."
"Not Verified | Worst airline experience ever flying. They are shameful. Cancelled flight to get to funeral, and replacement flight was 6 hours after the funeral. The airline could have accommodated us but despite being on standby, they took only frequent flyer passengers, which bumped us down the list. We missed the funeral. Southwest is the worst airline ever and made no concessions to help us arrive after they cancelled our outbound flight. You are at the mercy of this miserable airline. Highly recommend other competing airlines."
"Not Verified |  Flew last minute, paid a premium, unable to complete early check in due to common last name and S W requiring check in at airport. Would have gladly paid premium to board early and sit next to my husband and store my carry on item. Flight full. Favoritism with the flight attendants for seats and carry on storage. Unable to get a seat next to my husband. Unable to bring carry on, it was within requirements, due to not enough carry on spots on flight. Had to check luggage on connecting flight. Crammed in seats. No guarantee luggage will make to final destination now. Very disorganized. Will never fly Southwest again. Flight leaving 45 min late due to disorganization. No incentive offered even though they new the flight was overbooked and that there wouldn’t be enough room for carry on for flight. Thank you southwest for a great way to start a trip!"
"Not Verified | First and last time with Southwest. Delayed both ways. We were in the airport for at least 6 hours waiting for our flight back home. Finally got back just in time to go to work without sleeping. The seats were like rocks, extremely uncomfortable. Even the app works poorly. Only fly Southwest if there are no other options and you don’t have a schedule to keep."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I fly frequently for and 9 out 10 times I have a delay with Southwest Airlines. All I want to do is is get home today and once again another delay. Pay extra and book with another airline and get to your destination within  time. I can understand an occasional, but all the time."
"✅ Trip Verified |  LAX to San Jose and back to LAX the next day. Only when we started lining up to board did the ground crew start to activate the aircraft. We started boarding 10-15 minutes later and thanks to the quick work of the Southwest crew, we departed quickly and the flight was delayed by 7-10 minutes. Southwest offers Economy class seats and their seats are not too comfortable nor is it terrible.  I wish that their seats would recline just a bit further back though, There is an open-seating policy, which means that you are not assigned a seat prior to boarding and you can choose where you would like to sit. Flight attendants on Southwest were kind, friendly, and funny. Food and beverages are not exciting as they only offer snacks and a couple beverages like soda and hot chocolate, snacks and drinks are also free, except for alcohol. There are no IFE screens, but you can access a variety of entertainment by connecting to Southwest's WiFi that costs $8 per flight. The WiFi is quite slow however."
✅ Trip Verified |  This was my 2 kids first flight. They enjoyed flying into Detroit. The highlight of their experience came on the flight back the next day. Our pilot was a 25 year old female. Beautiful take off and Beautiful landing. She even took their experience further. She let them take pictures with her. Wherever you are young lady please keep doing what you are doing. You bring inspiration to other young ladies. You were so patient and so kind to my kids. I just wanted to thank you for your hospitality and grace. You are one of a kind. If we ever cross paths with you again it would be a blessing.
